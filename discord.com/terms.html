As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering new services, or stop offering old services. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes.

You can  provide a username and password, and a way of contacting you (such as an email address and/or phone number). To access certain features or communities, you may need to verify your account or add other information to your account. Our <a href="https://discord.com/new/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a> discusses what information we collect and how we use this information in more detail.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You are responsible for the security of your account, and you agree to <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>notify us</span></a> immediately if you believe your account has been compromised. If you use a password, it must be strong, and we (strongly) recommend that you use that password only for your Discord account and that you enable two-factor authentication. If your account is compromised, we may not be able to restore it to you.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You are also responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the contact information associated with your account. If you get locked out of your account, we’ll need to contact you at the email or phone number associated with your account, and we may not be able to restore your Discord account to you if you no longer have access to that email account or phone number. We may also assume that any communications we’ve received from your account or the associated contact information have been made by you.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You agree not to license, sell, or transfer your account without our prior written approval.</span><h1 id="content-in-discord’s-services">Content in Discord’s services<a class="hyperlink" href="#content-in-discord’s-services"><div name="content-in-discord’s-services"></div></a></h1><h2 id="your-content">Your Content<a class="hyperlink" href="#your-content"><div name="your-content"></div></a></h2><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">When we say “your content” in these terms, we mean all the things you add (upload, post, share, or stream) to our services. This may include text, links, GIFs, emoji, photos, videos, documents, or other media. If we come up with another way for you to add content to the services, it includes that too.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You don’t have any obligation to add content to the services. If you choose to add content to the services, you are responsible for ensuring that you have the right to do so, that you have the right to grant the licenses in the terms, and that your content is lawful. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for others’ use of your content.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">Our services allow users to add content in a number of different ways, including via direct messages and in smaller and larger communities. Some of these spaces are public, and if you share content within them, that content may be accessed by people you do not know. For example, some servers are available in the Server Discovery section of the app and do not require an invite link to join. Other server owners may publish their server invite link on public websites. Anyone can access these spaces. You should be aware that these permissions are set by server owners or admins, and they may change over time. Please understand the difference between posting in public and private spaces on Discord, and choose the right space, features, and settings for you and your content. To understand how we treat your personal information, see our <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Privacy Policy</span></a>.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Your content is yours, but you give us a license to it when you use Discord.</span> Your content may be protected by certain intellectual property rights.

The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by these terms and the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions (the “JAMS Rules”). These terms will govern if there’s a conflict between these terms and the JAMS Rules. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding on you and Discord, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Discord agree that dispositive motions will be allowed in the arbitration. Except as explicitly set forth in this arbitration section, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these terms of service, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms of service are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator must follow these terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Finally, if Discord’s or your claim is for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and doesn’t request any equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may, based solely on the documents submitted to the arbitrator, choose whether arbitration will be conducted through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules.  The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://www.jamsadr.com/</span></a> or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Other remedies</span>. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Arbitration costs</span>. Discord will pay the additional cost if the arbitration filing fee exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims that do not exceed $75,000, we’ll also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11). For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with JAMS Rules. In all arbitrations, unless  otherwise required by law or the JAMS Rules, you’re responsible for all other additional arbitration costs incurred, including attorney’s fees and expert witness costs.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Opt-out</span>. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing an opt-out notice to <a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</span></a> within 30 days of March 28, 2022 or when you first register your Discord account, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Discord also will not be bound by them.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="italics-2MHldx">Exceptions</span>. You or Discord may still pursue claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, or any U.S. county where you live or work. The small claims court, and not any arbitrator or JAMS, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve disputes regarding whether a dispute is properly within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.  Additionally, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of our services will not be subject to arbitration, and the informal notice required by this section won’t apply to these disputes.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Class waiver</span>. IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU AND DISCORD AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If this specific paragraph is found unenforceable, then the “Agreement to arbitrate” section will be null and void.  If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.</span><h1 id="more-important-stuff">More important stuff<a class="hyperlink" href="#more-important-stuff"><div name="more-important-stuff"></div></a></h1><span class="paragraph-3ckiht">You have certain rights that, by law, can’t be limited by these terms, and we in no way intend to restrict those rights in these terms.</span><span class="paragraph-3ckiht"><span class="underline-2cPmjS">Entire agreement</span>.
