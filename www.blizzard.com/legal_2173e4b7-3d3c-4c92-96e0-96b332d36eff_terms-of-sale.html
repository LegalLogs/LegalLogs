<p>The prices listed for physical goods available through Blizzard’s Online Services (referred to herein as “Merchandise”) do not include shipping, handling or taxes, if applicable.

</li>

<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Acceptance/Rejection/Returns.</strong></p>
<p>With regards to purchases of Merchandise from Blizzard's Online Services, note that you shall have a period of thirty (30) days following your receipt of Merchandise to examine it to confirm that it conforms to this Agreement and the offer made by Blizzard.
