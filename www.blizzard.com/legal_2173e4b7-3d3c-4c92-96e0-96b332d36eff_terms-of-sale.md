    The prices listed for physical goods available through Blizzard’s Online Services (referred to herein as “Merchandise”) do not include shipping, handling or taxes, if applicable. Prior to checking out, Blizzard will add all applicable shipping, handling and taxes to the price for the Merchandise you are purchasing.

    By placing an order for Merchandise through Blizzard’s Online Services, you agree that you are submitting a binding offer to purchase the Merchandise from Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. Your order is accepted and a contract concluded once Blizzard sends you a Confirmation Email. In the case of pre-orders of Digital Content, such as an interactive Game, the performance begins when Blizzard adds the respective license to your Battle.net account after sending you a Confirmation Email.
    
3.  **Shipping.**
    
    Merchandise will be shipped F.O.B. Fresno, California, unless Blizzard designates otherwise on Blizzard’s Online Services.

4.  **Delivery.**
    
    Delivery timescales/dates specified for the delivery of Merchandise to you, in any order acknowledgement, acceptance or elsewhere are estimates only, and while Blizzard endeavours to meet such timescales or dates, Blizzard does not undertake to dispatch products and/or commence services by a particular date or dates and shall not be liable to you in respect of delays or failure to do so. Merchandise delivery shall be to a valid address to the address submitted by you, and once Blizzard delivers the Merchandise to a transportation carrier at the designated shipping point, Blizzard's liability as to delivery ceases, and title and risk of loss passes to you.
    
5.  **Acceptance/Rejection/Returns.**
    
    With regards to purchases of Merchandise from Blizzard's Online Services, note that you shall have a period of thirty (30) days following your receipt of Merchandise to examine it to confirm that it conforms to this Agreement and the offer made by Blizzard.

After Blizzard has received your valid return, Blizzard will either: (i) repair the Merchandise, (ii) replace the Merchandise with an item of equivalent value; (iii) credit to the credit card used to pay for the product an amount equal to the value of the Merchandise (as determined by Blizzard in its reasonable discretion), or (iv) provide another remedy which Blizzard determines in good faith is appropriate in the specific circumstances. Lastly, note that all claims whether based on contract, negligence, strict liability or otherwise are waived unless made in writing and received by Blizzard within thirty (30) days after your receipt of Merchandise.
