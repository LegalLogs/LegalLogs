<p><strong class="text-priority-1">The Platform.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Battle.net Account. To use the Platform, you may be required to register, or have previously registered, a Battle.net Account (an “Account”). Certain Games may not require creation of an Account.  Use of the Games, and creation and use of Accounts, are subject to the following terms and conditions:
<ol>
<li>You may establish an Account only if: (i) you are a “natural person” and an adult in your country and state of residence (Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, partnerships and other legal or business entities may not establish an Account); and (ii) you are not an individual specifically prohibited by Blizzard from using the Platform.</li>
<li>When you create or update an Account, you must:
<ol>
<li>provide Blizzard with accurate and up to date information that is personal to you, such as your name, address, phone number, and email address.

</ol>
</li>
<li>To play Games, you may need to add a Game license to an Account, which may require an authentication code generated by Blizzard.

<li>Please take a few moments to review Blizzard’s Account Security information <a href="https://us.battle.net/en/security/" target="_blank" rel="external" class="legalAHover">here</a>.

<li>You are responsible for all uses of your Battle.net Balance.  If you suspect that your Battle.net Balance has been compromised, you should contact Blizzard Customer Service through <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/" target="_blank" rel="external" class="legalAHover">https://us.battle.net/support/en/</a> so that the matter can be investigated.

</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Beta Tests and Real Money Features.</strong> Certain Games may have features that will allow you to purchase licenses to use digital items or services through the Game’s interface. If you purchase a license to use a digital item or service through the Game’s interface during a Beta Test, all purchases are subject to the Terms of Sale. Blizzard will not provide you with a refund for your purchase of a digital item or service, and in some cases, items or services purchased during a Beta Test may not transition to the retail release version of a Game. In those cases, Blizzard will provide you with information that explains what, if any, credit you would receive for your purchase of digital goods or services for real money during a Beta Test once the Beta Test has concluded.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Feedback.</strong> During and after the Beta Test, you may be provided with an opportunity to give Blizzard your comments, suggestions and impressions of the Game by using tools to supply feedback and bug reports, internal websites and forums, and other methods. The Game may also include a tool that will allow your computer system to forward system and driver information to Blizzard in the event of a crash. This tool will collect data from your computer system related to the crash, and allow you to forward a report to Blizzard via electronic mail.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Acknowledgments.</strong>  You acknowledge that:

When Blizzard terminates a Beta Test, you must delete the pre-release version of the Game that was the subject of the Beta Test and all documents and materials you received from Blizzard in connection with the Beta Test, and you may be asked by Blizzard to remove any elements of the Beta from any hard drives on which the pre-release version of the Game that was the subject of the Beta Test has been installed.

<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Limitations of Liability.</strong> To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, Blizzard, its parent, subsidiaries, Licensors and affiliates shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of your use of, or inability to access or use, the Platform or Account(s). Blizzard’s liability shall never exceed the total fees paid by you to Blizzard during the six (6) months prior to your making a claim against Blizzard, unless applicable law explicitly disallows this limitation, in which case Blizzard’s liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Indemnity.</strong> You hereby agree to defend and indemnify Blizzard, its parent, subsidiaries, Licensors and affiliates against and from any third party claims, liabilities, losses, injuries, damages, costs or expenses incurred by Blizzard arising out of or from any violation by you of this Agreement or your misuse of the Platform or Account(s), or of any specific services or features associated therewith, including but not limited to User Content, Custom Games, Game Editors, Battle.net Balance, and this Agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Equitable Remedies.</strong> You agree that Blizzard would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically followed and enforced. In such an event, you agree that Blizzard shall be entitled, without bond or other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable relief in the event you breach this Agreement; and that the awarding of equitable relief to Blizzard will not limit its ability to receive remedies that are otherwise available to Blizzard under applicable laws.</p>

<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Alterations.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Alterations to the Agreement.</strong>
<ol>
<li>Blizzard’s Rights. Blizzard may create updated versions of this Agreement (each a “New Agreement”) as its business and the law evolve.</li>
<li>New Agreements. This Agreement will terminate immediately upon the introduction of a New Agreement. New Agreements will not be applied retroactively and cannot alter the process for resolving a Dispute between us once you have notified Blizzard of a Dispute. If you do not wish to be bound by a New Agreement, you must immediately cease using, and uninstall, the Platform and all Games.  Your continued use of your Account, the Platform, and/or the Games after Blizzard has published a New Agreement constitutes acceptance by you of the New Agreement.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Alterations to the Platform.</strong> Blizzard may change, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Platform or Accounts at any time, including removing items, or revising the effectiveness of items in an effort to balance a Game. Blizzard may also impose limits on certain features or restrict your access to parts or all of the Platform or Accounts without notice or liability.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Term and Termination.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Term.</strong> This Agreement is effective upon your creation of an Account, and shall remain in effect until it is terminated or superseded by a New Agreement, or, if neither of the foregoing events occur, as long as you continue using the Platform. In the event that Blizzard chooses to cease providing the Platform, or license to a third party the right to provide the Platform, Blizzard shall use reasonable commercial efforts to provide you with no less than three (3) months prior notice, unless the discontinuance arises from a matter that is beyond Blizzard’s control or causes the provision of such advance notice not to be possible or feasible. Neither the Platform nor Blizzard’s agreement to provide access to the Platform shall be considered a rental or lease of time on the capacity of Blizzard's servers or other technology.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">Termination</strong>
<ol>
<li>You may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying Blizzard by email through <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/" target="_blank" rel="external" class="legalAHover">https://us.battle.net/support/en/</a> and by uninstalling the Platform and the Games, but the Dispute Resolution provisions of this Agreement will survive termination and apply to all Disputes that arose or could have been initiated prior to termination.</li>
<li>Blizzard reserves the right to terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason, or for no reason, with or without notice to you. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most Account suspensions and terminations are the result of violations of this Agreement. In case of minor violations of these rules, Blizzard may provide you with a prior warning and/or suspend your use of the Account due to your non-compliance prior to terminating the Agreement or modifying or deleting an Account.</li>
<li>In the event of a termination of this Agreement, any right you may have had to any pre-purchased Game access or virtual goods, such as digital cards, currency, weapons, armor, wearable items, skins, sprays, pets, mounts, etc., are forfeit, and you agree and acknowledge that you are not entitled to any refund for any amounts which were pre-paid on your Account prior to any termination of this Agreement.  In addition, you will not be able to use the Platform.  The Dispute Resolution provisions of this Agreement will survive termination and apply to all Disputes that arose or could have been initiated prior to termination.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Dispute Resolution.</strong> <strong class="text-priority-1">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT OR TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">APPLICABILITY OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY.</strong> This binding individual arbitration section will not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your country of residence.  In the United States, this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.  To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and Blizzard agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration.  A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and Blizzard that relates to any aspect of our relationship, including, without limitation, your use or attempted use of the Platform, the Games, and all marketing related to them, your Battle.net Balance, any licensed content, and all matters arising under this Agreement, Blizzard’s Privacy Policy, or any other agreement between you and Blizzard, including the validity and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.  A Dispute shall be subject to binding, individual arbitration regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.  This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement.  You understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award is limited.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">INFORMAL NEGOTIATION PERIOD.</strong> In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute related to, or arising out of, the North American Battle.net End User License Agreement, which is incorporated into this policy, you and Blizzard agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except as set forth in Section 5 below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any arbitration or court proceeding. <strong class="text-priority-1">Notice must be provided within two (2) years of the Dispute having arisen, but in no event after the date on which the initiation of legal proceedings would have been barred under the applicable statute of limitations.  The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.</strong>
<ol>
<li>Negotiations will begin upon receipt of written notice by the party raising the Dispute. Blizzard will send its notice to your billing address and e-mail you a copy to the e-mail address you have provided to us.</li>
<li>You will send your notice to Blizzard at Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., 1 Blizzard Way, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn.: General Counsel.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">BINDING ARBITRATION.</strong> If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations, either you or Blizzard may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  The provision by you of a notice to Blizzard, containing all of the information referenced above, and your good-faith participation in the Informal Negotiation Period, are prerequisites to commencing arbitration.
<ol>
<li>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) effective as of the date on which you send us notice of a Dispute, which are available at the JAMS website, <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration" target="_blank" rel="external" class="legalAHover">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a>, as modified by this Agreement.</li>
<li>If, for any reason, JAMS is unable to provide the arbitration, you may file your Dispute with any national arbitration company that handles consumer arbitrations following procedures that are substantially similar to the JAMS Rules.</li>
<li>The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of arbitrability, including where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement.</li>
<li>If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims that are arbitrable and claims that are not, you and Blizzard agree that any non-arbitrable claims shall be stayed, absent a showing of prejudice to the complaining party, pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable issues. You or Blizzard can request the stay be lifted upon a showing of prejudice.</li>
<li>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Rules.</li>
<li>You and Blizzard agree that if a Dispute involves less than $10,000 at issue, the arbitrator may resolve the Dispute on the parties’ written submissions alone, without a hearing, unless the arbitrator believes a hearing is required.  For matters where the arbitrator believes a hearing is required, or for Disputes involving more than $10,000 but less than $25,000, hearings will be conducted by teleconference or videoconference, unless the arbitrator believes an in-person hearing is necessary.  In such instances, or for Disputes involving more than $25,000, the location of an arbitration hearing will be decided pursuant to the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Blizzard, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If either party unsuccessfully challenges the validity of an award, the unsuccessful party shall pay the opposing party’s costs and attorneys’ fees associated with the challenge.</li>
<li>THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS DESCRIBED HEREIN WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.  The arbitrator may not consolidate disputes against Blizzard by other individuals or entities unless Blizzard expressly consents to such consolidation.  This Agreement provides no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated, adjudicated, or resolved through proceedings on a class or representative basis or using class action procedures.  The arbitrator may award any relief that is permitted by applicable law with respect to your individual claim, but to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, may not award relief against the Company respecting any person other than you.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">CLASS AND COLLECTIVE ACTION WAIVER.</strong> To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and Blizzard agree that neither of us may participate as a class representative, private attorney general, or as a member of any class of claimants for any Dispute subject to arbitration or for any non-arbitrable claim pursued in court.
The arbitrator and any court shall construe the agreement to arbitrate and the agreement to waive class or collective actions in any manner that will render them enforceable and give them effect.  If, for any reason, this class or collective action waiver is deemed unenforceable by a court or arbitrator, you agree that the parties’ contract to arbitrate is then entirely void.  If any portion of this Agreement other than the class action waiver is found illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed and the remainder of this Agreement shall be given full force and effect. Any Dispute subject to any such portion of this Agreement shall be decided by the arbitrator.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">CHOICE OF LAW; VENUE FOR NON-ARBITRABLE DISPUTES.</strong> Unless this Agreement includes express language to the contrary, all Disputes shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
If you reside in the United States, for any claims not subject to binding individual arbitration, and which cannot be brought in small claims court in the county in which you reside as set forth below, you and Blizzard agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Orange County, California, and you and Blizzard consent to venue in and personal jurisdiction before such courts (but without prejudicing either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible).  This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.
If you are a (1) Canadian resident who has (2) purchased a license to a Game in Canada, other laws may apply if you choose not to agree to arbitrate as set forth above. Such laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent required by such jurisdiction. If such laws apply, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be given their maximum effect.  Users who access the Platform from outside of the United States and Canada, are responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws.</li>
<li><strong class="text-priority-1">EXCEPTIONS TO NEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION.</strong> You and Blizzard agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration:
<ol>
<li>any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of Blizzard’s intellectual property rights;</li>
<li>any Dispute related to, or arising from, claims that the other party has committed piracy;</li>
<li>individual actions duly filed in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction on a non-representative basis; any claim within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims courts;</li>
<li>enforcement actions pursued through a governmental agency if permitted by applicable law;</li>
<li>Blizzard’s right to seek injunctive relief to preserve the status quo pending or during an arbitration.
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<li>Blizzard may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign this Agreement without Blizzard’s prior written consent. Your assignment of this Agreement without Blizzard’s prior written consent shall be void.</li>
<li>Blizzard’s failure to enforce a provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a (i) waiver of such provision, or (ii) diminishment of any right to enforce such provisions. Further, Blizzard may choose to waive enforcement of a provision of this Agreement in a particular instance; however, you are still obligated to comply with that waived provision in the future.</li>
