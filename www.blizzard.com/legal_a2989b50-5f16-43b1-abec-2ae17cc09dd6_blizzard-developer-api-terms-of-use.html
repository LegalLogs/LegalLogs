<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Blizzard Developer APIs</strong>.  The “Blizzard Developer APIs” are a group of application programming interfaces created by or on behalf of Blizzard which allow licensees to, among other things, retrieve certain data regarding Blizzard’s customers, Blizzard, and/or certain of Blizzard’s games and services (“Data”) with the use of one or more OAuth clients (“API Key”) provided to You by Blizzard.  Blizzard makes the Blizzard Developer APIs available to qualified licensees subject to the following obligations, terms, and conditions, including Blizzard’s right to limit, change, suspend, or terminate any or all of the Blizzard Developer APIs entirely or Your access to them and/or to the website located at develop.battle.net (“Developer Site”) at any time and without notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">API And Data License</strong>.  Subject to Your compliance with these API Terms of Use, Blizzard grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable right and license for You to (1) use the API Key solely to access the Blizzard Developer APIs, (2) implement the Blizzard Developer APIs, solely as permitted hereunder, in conjunction with Your client libraries, desktop applications, services and daemons such as websites and web services, scripts and applications and/or utilities that You register when You request an API Key (“Application(s)”), and (3) distribute the Data to end users for their personal use via Your Application.  You may not use the API Key or the Data for any Applications that have not been registered with Blizzard or for any purpose not expressly authorized hereunder.  Also, although this license is free for You to use at this time, Blizzard reserves the right to charge a fee for use in the future.  This license is subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<ol>

<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Applications May Not Charge Premiums To Use The APIs</strong>. “Premium” versions of Applications offering additional for-pay features are not permitted, nor can players be charged money to download an Application, charged for services related to the Application, or otherwise be required to offer some form of monetary compensation to download or access an Application when those features use the Blizzard Developer APIs. Likewise, Applications may not include interstitials soliciting donations before features or functionality becomes available to the player.  Also, players may not be required to watch a video advertisement before accessing a feature or function of the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong class="text-priority-1">Applications May Not Contain Offensive Material</strong>. Applications may not be associated with nor contain any content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, as determined by Blizzard in Blizzard's sole discretion. Applications should only contain content appropriate for the ESRB rating for the related game(s). For example, World of Warcraft® has been rated “T for Teen” by the ESRB, and has received similar ratings from other ratings boards around the world and any Application using or displaying Data related to World of Warcraft shall be suitable for a “T for Teen” audience.</p>
</li>
<li>

If You exceed this limitation or otherwise operate the Application in a manner that degrades the performance of the Blizzard Developer APIs, Blizzard, or Blizzard’s games or services, Blizzard may suspend or terminate Your access to the Blizzard Developer APIs. You may not use other third-party services to make additional requests on Your behalf.</p>
</li>
<li>

Data protection laws in Europe, the United States and other countries give players the right to withdraw from the Data set you will be using. You must implement a maximum 30-day TTL (time-to-live) policy for all Data obtained through our APIs. This means You will retain data pulled from Blizzard Developer APIs for no longer than 30 days. If You are a World of Warcraft specific API developer, You have the option to perform the Data refresh by validating through an API if a character ID still exists on the Blizzard side. If it doesn’t exist when hitting this API, the character is invalid, and You must delete the character information associated with that ID and not display that information.</p>
