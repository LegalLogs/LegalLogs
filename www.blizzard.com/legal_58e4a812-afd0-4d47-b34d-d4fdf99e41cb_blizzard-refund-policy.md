_We’ve posted this policy to make our refund philosophy clear around purchases made from Blizzard on Battle.net. This document is part of our official [Terms of Sale](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/2173e4b7-3d3c-4c92-96e0-96b332d36eff/terms-of-sale)._

Our Philosophy
--------------

We believe in our mission to create epic entertainment experiences, and we want you to feel confident you’re getting the product and support you expect from Blizzard.

If you change your mind about a recent purchase, or if you haven’t used it, we’ll try to work with you on a refund.

We may withdraw refund eligibility for abuse of this policy, such as repeated refunds for the same product. The same goes for violations of the [In-Game Code of Conduct](https://battle.net/support/article/42673) or the [End User License Agreement](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement).

How to Request a Refund
-----------------------

You can usually request a refund automatically using our [support site](http://battle.net/support/help/) and selecting the relevant game or product.

We will typically refund purchases to the method of payment used for the original transaction. In some cases, such as those where the original payment method cannot be refunded, we may provide the refund in the form of Battle.net Balance.

If the automated service doesn’t address your needs, our support team is available to [help](http://battle.net/support/help/).

Refund Guidelines
-----------------

### Games and Expansions

We refund paid games or expansions within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven’t played for more than two hours.

Examples include:

*   World of Warcraft and its expansions (Battle for Azeroth, Shadowlands)
*   Diablo III and its expansions (Reaper of Souls, Rise of the Necromancer)
*   Overwatch
*   Warcraft III: Reforged
*   StarCraft: Remastered
*   Diablo II: Resurrected

### In-Game Items

We’ll refund most items that you buy with real money and use or receive in-game within 14 days of purchase, as long as you have not claimed, opened, or otherwise used the item.

Examples include:

*   Overwatch Loot Boxes
*   World of Warcraft Pets and Mounts
*   World of Warcraft Character Level Boosts
*   WoW Tokens
*   StarCraft II Commanders and Mission Packs
*   Heroes of the Storm Boosts

Hearthstone packs, heroes, adventures, and passes are non-refundable. WoW Tokens listed on the Auction House are non-refundable. Opening a single item as part of a larger bundle purchase counts as claiming that bundle.

### Blizzard Balance and Virtual Currency

We’ll refund purchases of Blizzard Balance and ‘Virtual Currency’ within 14 days of purchase, as long as you haven’t spent the currency yet.

The term ‘Virtual Currency’ only applies to in-game currencies purchased with real money.

Examples include:

*   Heroes of the Storm Gems
*   Overwatch League Tokens

### World of Warcraft Game Services

We’ll refund certain World of Warcraft services within three days of purchase. Examples include:

*   Race, Name, or Faction Changes
*   Character Transfers
*   Guild Name Changes

A refund will revert the service your character or guild received.

### Subscriptions

We’ll refund any unused World of Warcraft subscription within 14 days of the purchase.

We won’t refund subscription time lost due to a suspension and/or permanent account closure. For permanent account closures and suspensions longer than 15 days, we will cancel upcoming recurring subscriptions.

### Pre-Purchases

We’ll typically refund any pre-purchased game or product prior to its release, provided you haven't played the game or expansion for more than two hours via pre-purchase early access.

Some exceptions may apply in cases where the pre-purchase includes in-game benefits that can be claimed for other products. If you’ve already claimed or used those added benefits, the purchase would become non-refundable.

### Gift Purchases

We’ll refund unclaimed gifts within 14 days at the purchaser’s request. If the recipient has claimed but not yet used the gift, the recipient must request the refund. Other refund eligibility limitations still apply as listed above.

Eligible gift refunds are credited back to the original purchaser.

Refunds for Third-Party Purchases
---------------------------------

We can only provide refunds for purchases made on our own platform. This includes the Blizzard Shop, the Battle.net App, and in-game.

We cannot refund games, in-game items, or products purchased in retail locations or from other online sellers and storefronts, including on mobile or console. Purchases made through Amazon, Apple, Google, Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, etc. are subject to that retailer’s refund policy.

BlizzCon Refund Policies

Gear Store Refunds
------------------

The Blizzard Gear Store return policy and support process are available on the Blizzard Gear Store.
