        <p class="last-update">Last updated: 20 July 2022</p>
        <p class="top-text">Hello! We are CD PROJEKT RED, part of the CD PROJEKT SA group, and we make games, including The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. We've put a lot of work into building CD PROJEKT RED and as a result we need to have some rules about what you can and can't do with our games and services. We've put this Agreement together as simply as we legally can, with some informal short summaries to help you understand what it means. However, the full text wording is what is important/binding legally.</p>

                                <p>1.1 <u>This Agreement.</u> This Agreement is a legally binding contract between you and CD PROJEKT S.A., seated at ul. Jagiellonska 74; 03-301, Warsaw, Poland.<br>
<br>
Just so you know, <strong>CD PROJEKT RED</strong> is the name of the game development studio within CD PROJEKT S.A., so we will refer to ourselves throughout this Agreement as "<strong>CD PROJEKT RED</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>".<br>
<br>
This Agreement applies to <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/">cyberpunk.net</a>, <a href="https://thewitcher.com/">thewitcher.com</a>, <a href="https://cdprojektred.com/">cdprojektred.com</a>, any other CD PROJEKT RED websites, any and all CD PROJEKT RED games (except those specifically mentioned below) including The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, The Witcher Battle Arena or The Witcher Adventure Game, CD PROJEKT RED forums, wikis, blogs, social media accounts, CD PROJEKT RED accounts, CD PROJEKT RED customer and technical support and any other services we provide to you (we'll call all this "<strong>CD PROJEKT RED games and services</strong>" for short).<br>
<br>
This Agreement does not apply to Gwent or Cyberpunk 2077, which each have their own legal documents (you can find Gwent’s EULA <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/user-agreement">here</a> and Cyberpunk 2077’s EULA <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/user-agreement">here</a>).<br>
<br>
It is binding on you and us once you use any CD PROJEKT RED games and services. If you do not agree to it, you are not permitted to use the CD PROJEKT RED games and services. <br>
<br>
<strong>Important:</strong> please also make sure you read our: (a) game/service specific rules (e.g. the Witcher 3 EULA) - which explain in more detail the legal rules for specific games or services; and (b) CD PROJEKT RED <a href="https://regulations.cdprojektred.com/en/privacy_policy/">Privacy Policy</a> - which details CD PROJEKT RED’s collection, usage and protection of your personal information. Our <a href="https://cdprojektred.com/fan-content">Fan Content Guidelines</a> explain what you can and cannot do with fan content about our games and services. All of these documents form part of this Agreement and we may update them from time to time. You may also need to agree and follow terms and conditions of any digital distribution platforms which you use to access and play CD PROJEKT RED games and services, such as our awesome sister company GOG.<br>
<br>
Our modding tools for The Witcher, and REDKit for The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, are covered by their existing legal documents. </p>

You should only play our games if you meet the applicable minimum age rating. If you are above the applicable minimum age rating and you are over 18 (or whatever is the age of adulthood in your country) then please enjoy our games. If you are under 18 (or whatever is the age of adulthood in your country) – before we extend an equally warm welcome, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this Agreement on your behalf (because in some countries people under a certain age cannot legally enter fully into contracts like this Agreement), plus they should supervise your use of the games, even if the age rating for a given game is lower than 18 year. </p>

•        your access to the beta will usually be time-limited and there may be some additional contract terms;<br>
•        you will probably be asked to participate in a feedback process in which you can offer information about how the beta works; <br>
•        the beta software will be provided 'as is' without any additional promises from us or any liability on us if the software isn't complete or doesn't work fully or causes issues. After all, that's the point of us giving you beta access: you get beta access to something new, but you recognise that it won't be complete yet; and<br>
•        the game or service may have specific legal rules of its own for its beta, so check them out.<br>
