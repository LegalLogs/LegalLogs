CD PROJEKT RED - FAN CONTENT GUIDELINE
======================================

Last updated on December 10, 2020

Hello! We’re CD PROJEKT RED and we make video games like The Witcher, GWENT: The Witcher Card Game, Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales and Cyberpunk 2077. We really appreciate all the work that our community puts into showing their love for our games and, to support you in this, we‘ve put together these guidelines. They also include some legal stuff (we’re sorry about that, but we hope you will understand it is intended to protect our games, you and us). If you have any questions, you can reach us at legal@cdprojektred.com.

###### SECTION 1 - WHAT KIND OF FAN CONTENT CAN I MAKE?

We’re happy for you to make nearly any kind of fan content within reason and if it follows these guidelines – for example:

*   making gameplay videos or streams on sites like YouTube and Twitch,
    
*   drawing some amazing fanart involving our characters and posting it on social media - we know our community is full of talented van Roghs!
    
*   creating cosplay props and cosplaying characters from our games,
    
*   taking screenshots of our games and sharing them online, or turning them into wallpaper, or a poster for your bedroom wall,
    
*   creating a community website, fan page or news group for our games,
    
*   creating software that works alongside our games, like overlay software,
    

. . . And we’re sure you’ll come up with even more creative ideas!

###### SECTION 2 - THE GOLDEN RULE

Like we said earlier, we’d love you to unleash your creativity and make amazing things inspired by our games. That said, we want to keep our games safe and we’d rather not see copies, mutations or other kinds of clones flying around. We’re sure you would not like to see that either, would you? So, our legal team asked us to put in place some ‘Golden Rules’ which apply to all fan content – here they are:

*   No commercial usage. We’d love for your fan content to be created by fans, for fans. Therefore, you cannot do anything with our games for any commercial purpose, unless explicitly permitted otherwise below (e.g. see section 3 about videos and streams). We’re happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you’re not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don’t make content only available to paid subscribers).
    
*   Make it clearly ‘unofficial’. Please make sure your fan content clearly displays the following (or similar) wording in a sensible and obvious location: “This is an unofficial fan work and is not approved/endorsed by CD PROJEKT RED”. Please don’t do or say anything which could make anyone think we endorse or support you. Of course, if we feel your fan content is so awesome that we want to endorse or approve your work then we’ll let you know! Remember - the fan content you make is your responsibility.
    
*   Don’t put it in other games/products. Your fan content should stand on its own – it should not be incorporated into a third-party game or product (except as we explain below).
    
*   Don’t hurt us or others. Please be respectful to other players, fans and our games! Don’t create, do or say anything regarding our games that is racist, xenophobic, sexist, defamatory, illegal or offensive, or anything that could harm CD PROJEKT RED, its games, users or staff. Also, please don’t infringe the rights of other people (e.g. creators of other games, movies, books, TV shows etc.). This is also relevant for any real-life brands and people included in our games – you’re only allowed to use those brands or images of those people if they allow you to do so and provided you don’t harm them in any way! Basically, when making fan content, make sure you’ve got permission from all the people concerned (which might be people other than us).
    
*   Follow the legal rules. These guidelines are our informal guidance to you, but the full legal rules are our CD PROJEKT RED [User Agreement](https://regulations.cdprojektred.com/user_agreement/) and End User License Agreements (EULAs) for each game (e.g. [The Witcher](https://regulations.cdprojektred.com/en/witcher3/), [GWENT](https://www.playgwent.com/user-agreement) and [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net/user-agreement/)). If there’s any conflict between these guidelines and those documents, then those documents win.
    

###### SECTION 3 - ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC RULES I SHOULD BE AWARE OF FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF FAN CONTENT?

Yes! In addition to the Golden Rules above, we have some specific rules for certain types of fan content:

*   Videos and streams.
    
    *   We think it’s awesome that our community makes such fantastic playthroughs, walkthroughs, Let’s Play videos, achievement guides and video reviews! We encourage everyone to create videos using content from our games, as well as livestream our games to the public. Please feel free to publish your fan content on YouTube, Twitch and other video sharing websites.
        
    *   We’re cool with you monetising your videos and streams via the YouTube and Twitch partner programs (plus other similar video/stream sharing site programs), but as mentioned above, these should never be behind a paywall.
        
    *   Important: please don’t use content from our games in videos and streams which aren’t actually related in any way to our games (e.g. don’t use our cinematics or gameplay videos in the background of things like music videos). If you want to use our games for something unrelated, ask us in advance via legal@cdprojektred.com.
        
*   Music
    
    *   For some of our games we may not own all the music outright (e.g. some of the radio music in Cyberpunk 2077). When we don’t own the music, you may need permission from other third parties before using that music in your fan content. You might even need permission from more than one person or company (e.g. the composer and the music label) - please see the “credits” section of our games to see relevant owners. Music licensing is complicated, so please be careful when using music from our games.
        
    *   For videos and streams of Cyberpunk 2077 specifically we’ve introduced a tool that allows creators to turn off music we don’t own and which is not “streamable” – we recommend you have a read of our statement on the topic [here](https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/36734/dedicated-cyberpunk-2077-feature-for-content-creators-disable-copyrighted-music).
        
    *   For music that we do own, please don’t use it in ways that are unrelated to our games (e.g. as a background music in a video about someone else’s product). We’re happy for you to do your own covers of our music (e.g. your own versions of Priscilla’s “The Wolven Storm” from The Witcher 3 or “V” from Cyberpunk 2077) and you can monetise these as outlined in the videos and streams section above, but no other commercial use is allowed. Also, we don’t allow remixes in any circumstances – sorry!
        
*   Mods. We’re happy for you to make mods for our games (i.e. software that modifies or works with our games – e.g. changing the UI or adding new mechanics) so long as it doesn’t breach the relevant game’s EULA (e.g. no cheating – this is especially important for GWENT!). If you want to make a mod for another game or service using our content, or make the mod a standalone product, ask us in advance via legal@cdprojektred.com (we just don’t want the next Soulkiller virus).
    
*   Websites. As we mentioned, we think it’s great that you want to run community websites and other fan pages – please just make sure that any domains do not include any of our game or company names, trade marks or anything similar (e.g. Cyberpunk2078.com would not be cool).
    
*   Games and Mobile Apps. Please do not make a video game or any mobile app that uses, is related to, or is based on our games.
    

###### SECTION 4 - WHO OWNS THE FAN CONTENT I CREATE

You own the new, original fan content you create. However, since your fan content is based on our content, we may want to show it off on our social media, make it available to other players in our games (e.g. in case of your mods) etc. In order for us to be able to use and transmit your fan content we need you to give us certain rights over it. So, we kindly ask that you give us from the moment of creation of your fan content a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free licence to use, modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, distribute, exploit, transmit, perform and communicate your fan content in connection with our games. From our side, rest assured that if your creation stands out we will do our best to reach out, have a chat and grant you appropriate recognition.  
  
Just to be clear, the content from our games (e.g. characters, setting, gameplay and appearance) is and will be still owned by us.

###### SECTION 5 - WHAT IF I HAVE A GREAT REASON TO DO SOMETHING PROHIBITED BY THE GOLDEN RULES OR OTHER SPECIFIC RULES MENTIONED ABOVE?

Well, you really shouldn’t do it, but if you have questions then you can get in touch with legal@cdprojektred.com. Please keep in mind that our lawyers care deeply about our community and will do everything they can to eventually come back to you. Unfortunately, they are a busy bunch, so it might take them a while to dig out from under all those lawyery things and get back to you. However, remember that no response from their side doesn’t mean we agree to the stuff you proposed in your message.

###### SECTION 6 - CHANGES TO THESE GUIDELINES

We might need to update these guidelines from time to time as people make cool new fan content with our games. When we do, we’ll post an update on www.cdprojektred.com. Once we change these guidelines, the updated version will become legally binding 30 days after we post it online. During that period, you're welcome to contact us at legal@cdprojektred.com if you have specific questions about the changes.

###### SECTION 7 - ANYTHING ELSE?

If something isn’t clear to you in these guidelines, please ask us! If there’s anything you think we could add to make it clearer, let us know (but no promises)! All rights and other matters not related to fan content are reserved to us, so be careful. Again, you can contact us at legal@cdprojektred.com.
