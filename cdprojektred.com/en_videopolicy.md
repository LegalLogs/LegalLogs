Video Policy
============

We encourage everyone to create videos using content from our games, as well as livestream them to the public - on YouTube, Twitch and other video sharing websites. We ask you to remember that the use of our content in your videos and streams has to be non-commercial. You can, however, become a part of the YouTube, Twitch, or similar partnership programs and monetize your videos or streams. Please do not use content from our games in videos and streams which aren’t related in any way to our games.  
  
Also, for Cyberpunk 2077, be sure to have the “Disable Copyrighted Music” toggle set to "ON" in the game's settings – it will disable a small portion of in-game tracks to help you avoid demonetization or takedowns of your content.  
  
Remember – the rules above are just a short recap. Please refer to [Fan Content Guidelines](https://cdprojektred.com/fan-content/) for details. Other than that; all we have to say is: create, have fun, be awesome!
