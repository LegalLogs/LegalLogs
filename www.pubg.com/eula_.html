<p><strong>INDEMNITY</strong><br>
Unless there are intentional acts or gross negligence by PUBG, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to PUBG, its partners, affiliates, contractors, licensors, officers, directors, employees and agents from all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising directly or indirectly from your acts or omissions in connection with using the Game Software or any breach by you of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong><br>
If a dispute arises between You and PUBG, our goal is to provide You with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, You and PUBG agree to resolve any claim or controversy at law or in equity that arises from or relates to this Legal Agreement or our service (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below.<br>
The Legal Agreement and the relationship between You and PUBG shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Republic of Korea without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.<br>
You and PUBG agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the Republic of Korea. Notwithstanding this, You agree that PUBG is allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
For any Claim, excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the Claim in a cost-effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
All Claims you bring against PUBG must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All Claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section will be considered improperly filed. If You file a Claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, PUBG may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to One Thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD) under the condition that any damage or loss was not caused by intentional act or gross negligence by PUBG, provided that PUBG notifies You in writing of the improperly filed Claim and You fail to promptly withdraw the Claim.</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong><br>
PUBG reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any time, at its sole discretion, but will post such changes on the website <a class="bb_link" href="https://www.pubg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pubg.com</a> and/or will communicate such changes through the Steam service. If any such future changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the above Termination provisions. Your installation and use of any updates or modifications to the Game Software or your continued use of the Game Software following notice of changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of any and all such changes to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br>
This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and PUBG concerning the License and your rights to use the Game Software, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or understandings between you and PUBG (whether negligently or innocently made but excluding those made fraudulently), regarding the same subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and not be affected.</p>
