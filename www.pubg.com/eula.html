<p><strong>LIMITED WARRANTY</strong><br>
THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND UNLESS THERE ARE INTENTIONAL ACTS OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE FROM PUBG, PUBG HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WRITTEN OR ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
Without limiting any of the foregoing, PUBG does not ensure continuous, error-free, secure or virus-free operation of the PUBG Services or Your Account under the condition that any damage or loss was not intentional or caused due to gross negligence by PUBG. Some states or countries do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, and the foregoing disclaimer may not be applicable to You. This warranty gives You specific legal rights, and You may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state or from country to country.</p>
<p><strong>LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES</strong><br>
UNDER THE CONDITION THAT ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS WAS NOT CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL ACTS BY PUBG OR ITS LICENSORS, PUBG OR ITS LICENSORS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE GAME SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES CONNECTED WITH OR CONSISTING OF LOST PROFITS, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR FILES, LOSS OF GOODWILL, CONSOLE, COMPUTER OR HANDHELD DEVICE FAILURE, ERRORS AND LOST BUSINESS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF POSSESSION, USE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE GAME SOFTWARE, OR PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF PUBG HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THE CONDITION THAT ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS WAS NOT CAUSED BY GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL ACTS BY PUBG OR ITS LICENSORS, PUBG OR ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR ANY OTHER TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. PUBG’S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID FOR THE GAME SOFTWARE AS LONG AS THE DAMAGE WAS NOT CAUSED BY INTENTIONAL ACTS OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE BY PUBG. THE FOREGOING APPLIES EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p><strong>TERM AND TERMINATION</strong><br>
Without prejudice to any other rights of PUBG, the License shall remain in effect for as long as you use, operate or run the Game. The License shall terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions. In such event, you must uninstall and destroy all copies of the Game Software. You may also terminate the License at any time by destroying the Game Software and uninstalling it from your computer(s) or other applicable hardware. The Sections entitled “Ownership,” “License Conditions and Restrictions,” “Limitations on Damages,” “Term and Termination,” “Injunction,” “Indemnity,” “DISPUTE RESOLUTION,” and “Miscellaneous” shall survive any termination of this License.</p>
<p><strong>INJUNCTION</strong><br>
Because PUBG would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that PUBG shall be entitled, without bond or other security or proof of damages, to take such action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other equitable remedies, in addition to any other remedies available to it under the applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>INDEMNITY</strong><br>
Unless there are intentional acts or gross negligence by PUBG, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to PUBG, its partners, affiliates, contractors, licensors, officers, directors, employees and agents from all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising directly or indirectly from your acts or omissions in connection with using the Game Software or any breach by you of the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong><br>
If a dispute arises between You and PUBG, our goal is to provide You with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, You and PUBG agree to resolve any claim or controversy at law or in equity that arises from or relates to this Legal Agreement or our service (a “Claim”) in accordance with one of the subsections below.<br>
The Legal Agreement and the relationship between You and PUBG shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Republic of Korea without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.<br>
You and PUBG agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the Republic of Korea. Notwithstanding this, You agree that PUBG is allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
For any Claim, excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars ($10,000.00 USD), the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the Claim in a cost-effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
All Claims you bring against PUBG must be resolved in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section. All Claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section will be considered improperly filed. If You file a Claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, PUBG may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to One Thousand U.S. Dollars ($1,000.00 USD) under the condition that any damage or loss was not caused by intentional act or gross negligence by PUBG, provided that PUBG notifies You in writing of the improperly filed Claim and You fail to promptly withdraw the Claim.</p>
<p><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong><br>
PUBG reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any time, at its sole discretion, but will post such changes on the website <a class="bb_link" href="https://www.pubg.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pubg.com</a> and/or will communicate such changes through the Steam service. If any such future changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you may terminate this Agreement in accordance with the above Termination provisions. Your installation and use of any updates or modifications to the Game Software or your continued use of the Game Software following notice of changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of any and all such changes to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br>
This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and PUBG concerning the License and your rights to use the Game Software, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or understandings between you and PUBG (whether negligently or innocently made but excluding those made fraudulently), regarding the same subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and not be affected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions concerning this Agreement or the License contained therein, you may contact PUBG at 7F, 8F Majestar City Tower 1, 12, Seocho-daero 38-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea, Attn. Legal Department.</p>
