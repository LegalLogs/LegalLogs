Twitch Accessibility Statement
==============================

You’re already one of us.

As children, some of our earliest memories came from the playground. When we played together, we made cherished memories. _That’s_ what we want Twitch to be: A place where anyone can play and make memories together.

To make our content more accessible for everyone, we design, develop, and maintain following the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). To this end, we:

*   Train our designers, developers, and content managers in accessibility
*   Include accessibility documentation in our core components; and
*   Performing regular automated, semi-automated, and manual reviews of our content.

If you enjoy using the Twitch experience, or have trouble with any part of it, please let us know!

*    Email us your story: [accessibility@twitch.tv](mailto:accessibility@twitch.tv)
*   UserVoice to request features: [https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/926080-accessibility](https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/926080-accessibility)
*   If you want to help, work with us! [https://www.twitch.tv/jobs/](https://www.twitch.tv/jobs/)

Because Twitch provides the playground, but does not control the play taking place, we cannot create accurate audio descriptions for the millions of hours of video content streamed on our platform daily.

Photosensitive Seizure Warning
==============================

Twitch allows you to watch streams of video game play and other types of visual content. A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain visual images, including light patterns or flashing lights that may appear in video games or other visual content. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while watching video games or viewing chat, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals. Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in your family, have an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to watching content on Twitch.

If you experience any of the following symptoms while watching – dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions – discontinue use IMMEDIATELY and consult your physician before resuming use of Twitch.
