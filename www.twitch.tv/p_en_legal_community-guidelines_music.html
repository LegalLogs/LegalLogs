<h1 id="music-guidelines"><strong>Music Guidelines</strong></h1>

<p>Twitch values the work of songwriters, musicians, and other creative artists. As a company committed to supporting creators, we respect, and ask our users to respect, the intellectual property of those who make music and those who own or control music rights.</p>

<p>We know that you may have questions about what types of music content you can safely share on Twitch. To help you better understand what uses of music are allowed, please read the sections below.</p>

<h2 id="using-music-on-twitch"><strong>Using Music on Twitch</strong></h2>

<p>Put simply, you should only include music in your Twitch channel if you’re sure you have the necessary rights or authority to do so. Using unauthorized music on Twitch may result in a rights holder sending a takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) or similar laws or through a separate contractual process. If a rights holder sends Twitch one of these takedown requests against content on your Twitch channel, it can result in enforcement against your channel, up to and including account termination.</p>

<p>Please note that subscribing to a music streaming service or buying a CD or MP3 typically does not grant you rights to share that music on Twitch. Such a purchase or subscription typically grants you a personal license to access the content only for your personal and private playback. We encourage you to review each service’s terms of use and other relevant legal pages before including music from that service in your Twitch streams.</p>

<h2 id="specific-uses-of-music"><strong>Specific Uses of Music</strong></h2>

<p>In the sections below, we describe several music uses you might be familiar with, along with some information about whether and how music can be used in those ways on Twitch.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here are some example types of music content you <u>may</u> include in Twitch streams and on-demand content (e.g., VODs and Clips):</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Music Owned By You</strong> – Original music which was written by you and either recorded or performed live by you, and for which you own or control all rights necessary to share the music on Twitch, including the rights to the recording, performance, and underlying music and lyrics. Please remember that if you have a contractual relationship with an organization that controls rights to the content you create, such as a record label or publishing company, you should make sure that you are not in violation of that relationship by sharing that music on Twitch.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Music Licensed To You</strong> – Copyrighted music owned in whole or in part by someone other than you, if you have secured a license to share it on Twitch from all of the relevant copyright holder(s).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Music Streamed Using Soundtrack by Twitch</strong> – Music added to your live streams using <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/music/#soundtrack-by-twitch">Soundtrack by Twitch</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Here are some example types of music content you <u>may not</u></em></strong> <strong><em>include in Twitch streams or recorded videos (e.g., VODs and Clips):</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Radio Station-Style Broadcast</strong> – Radio station-style broadcasts of recorded music without a live visual performance, unless you own the necessary rights to stream the music on Twitch and have signed a contract with Twitch setting out an exemption for your channel from this rule.</li>
  <li><strong>DJ Set</strong> – Playing and/or mixing pre-recorded music tracks, unless those tracks are owned by you or are licensed for you to share on Twitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Karaoke Performance</strong> – Singing or performing with a karaoke recording unless you own or are licensed to share that music on Twitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Lip Synch Performance</strong> – Pantomiming, singing, or pretending to sing to music that is not owned by you or is not licensed for you to share on Twitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Music Depiction</strong> – Lyrics, music notation, tablature, or any other visual representation of copyrighted music other than music owned by you or music which is licensed for you to share on Twitch.</li>
  <li><strong>Cover Song Performance</strong> – Performance of a song owned by someone else, with the exception of a live performance in your Twitch stream. If you do perform a cover song in a live Twitch stream, please make a good faith effort to perform the song as written by the songwriter(s), and create all audio elements yourself, without incorporating instrumental tracks, music recordings, or any other recorded elements owned by others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="uses-permitted-by-law"><strong>Uses Permitted by Law</strong></h2>

<p>Our community is a place for streamers to express themselves in remarkable, creative and sometimes transformative ways. In addition to sharing the guidelines above, we think it’s important to note that not all musical works are copyrighted and not all unauthorized uses of copyrighted music are infringing uses. Some examples include uses of works in the public domain and uses of copyrighted works that qualify for a defense under fair use and similar laws outside the US. We recommend reviewing the counter-notification and retraction policies in our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/">DMCA Guidelines</a> if you believe you have received a takedown notification from a rights holder as the result of a mistake or misidentification.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-impacts-you"><strong>How This Impacts You</strong></h2>

<p>If you violate these guidelines, your content may be subject to a takedown notification from music rights holders under our DMCA Guidelines and/or penalties under our Reporting Process for Participating Music Rights Holders (“Music Reporting Process”). These two processes are summarized below, and additional detail can be found in our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/">DMCA Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/dmca-guidelines/music-reporting-process/">Music Reporting Process help page</a>.</p>

<p>Twitch also scans creators’ VODs and Clips for copyrighted audio as a proactive measure to help broadcasters avoid creating recorded videos that contain copyrighted audio. A high-level overview of this system is described below, and details can be found in our <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-appeal-flagged-content">Muted Audio help article</a>.</p>

<h5 class="eu-excluded" id="dmca-process"><strong>DMCA Process</strong></h5>

<p>The DMCA and similar laws around the world require services like Twitch to take certain actions when rights holders claim that users have infringed their copyrights on the service. Twitch has established guidelines that describe how Twitch receives notifications of claimed infringement from rights holders, allows creators to dispute those notifications, removes allegedly infringing material, and issues strikes under its repeat infringer policy. This process applies for all types of copyrighted works, including music. For more information, please see our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/">DMCA Guidelines</a>.</p>

<h5 class="eu-excluded" id="music-reporting-process"><strong>Music Reporting Process</strong></h5>

<p>Twitch enters into contractual arrangements with certain music rights holders that define how their copyrighted works can be used on the service. These arrangements provide for a separate reporting and handling process, which we call the Music Reporting Process. This process gives more flexibility to creators who inadvertently or incidentally use these rights holders’ copyrighted works in their Twitch channels. For certain egregious uses of these rights holders’ copyrighted works, Twitch will issue a warning to creators for their first offense, and issue penalties for subsequent offenses. Twitch may also suspend livestreams and/or delete recorded videos that include copyrighted music in a prohibited way. For more information, please see our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/dmca-guidelines/music-reporting-process">Music Reporting Process</a>.</p>

<h5 class="eu-excluded" id="automatic-muting-or-removal-of-recorded-videos"><strong>Automatic Muting or Removal of Recorded Videos</strong></h5>

<p>In addition, Twitch may mute VODs and delete Clips where our audio recognition system detects copyrighted audio in them. If you have the necessary rights to share music or other copyrighted audio in your Twitch VODs, we want to ensure that your VODs are not muted. To learn about how to appeal muted audio, please read our help article on <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-appeal-flagged-content?language=en_US">How To Appeal Muted Content</a>.</p>

<h2 id="soundtrack-by-twitch">Soundtrack by Twitch</h2>

<p>We understand that music rights are complex and that many of you would like a simpler way to add high-quality music to your Twitch live streams. That’s why we built Soundtrack by Twitch (“Soundtrack”), to give you the ability to feature a curated library of fully licensed music within your live streams. We’re also excited for you and your community to discover new artists along the way.</p>

<p>Please note that as Soundtrack is built for live streaming, the music featured in Soundtrack is intended for use only in live Twitch broadcasts. We designed Soundtrack with multi-track audio so you can create on-demand videos of live streams (e.g., VODs and Clips) that do not include this music, but still have all the audio from you and your stream preserved for future enjoyment. What this means is that you may not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create on-demand videos containing Soundtrack music – we have designed Soundtrack with this restriction in mind, and proper setup will allow you to create and use music-free on-demand videos of live streams that include Soundtrack music; or</li>
  <li>Live stream content that includes music or other materials from Soundtrack outside Twitch.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access our Soundtrack web player and desktop app <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/soundtrack">here</a>. You can learn more about how to download, install, and use Soundtrack <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/soundtrack?">here</a>.</p>
