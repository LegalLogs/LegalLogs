Instruction on the Statutory Right of Withdrawal
------------------------------------------------

#### 1\. SERVICE CONTRACTS  & CONTRACTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF DIGITAL CONTENT NOT SUPPLIED ON A TANGIBLE MEDIUM

#### Right of Withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us, Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Customer Support, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, [support@twitch.tv](mailto:support@twitch.tv) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter sent by post or e-mail).

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

#### Effects of Withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

##### **END OF INSTRUCTION ON THE STATUTORY RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM SERVICE CONTRACTS & CONTRACTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF DIGITAL CONTENT NOT SUPPLIED ON A TANGIBLE MEDIUM**

#### Early Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal

For contracts on the provision of services, your right of withdrawal shall expire when the services have been fully performed but, if the contract places you under an obligation to pay, only if the performance has begun after (i) you gave your prior express consent to beginning the provision of the services and (ii) you acknowledged that you would thereby lose your right of withdrawal upon the services’ full performance.

For contracts on the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, your right of withdrawal shall expire when performance has begun, and, if the contract places you under an obligation to pay, where (i) you gave your prior express consent to beginning the performance and (ii) you acknowledged that you would thereby lose your right of withdrawal, and (iii) we provided you with the confirmation of the contract that was concluded, on a durable medium (e.g., e-mail), including a confirmation of your prior express consent and acknowledgment to beginning the performance.

#### **2\. SALES CONTRACTS** 

#### Right of Withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day on which you acquire, or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires, physical possession of the goods.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us, Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: Customer Support, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104, [support@twitch.tv](mailto:support@twitch.tv) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter sent by post or e-mail). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

#### Effects of Withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.

You shall send back the goods or hand them over to us, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the goods before the period of 14 days has expired.
