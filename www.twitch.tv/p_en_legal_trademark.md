### Introduction

We support and encourage ideas, services, tools and other creative works that use and supplement Twitch Brand Assets (meaning Twitch’s trademarks, logos, trade dress, web pages, copyrighted designs, original content, or other brand assets), but we’re required to protect our reputation and brand identity.

If there is express language on this page stating that you can use particular Twitch Brand Assets, advance written permission is not necessary. By using Twitch Brand Assets you agree to follow these guidelines, Twitch’s Terms of Service, and all other Twitch rules and policies, and, in situations where Twitch provided express permission, any other terms associated with that permission. Twitch reserves the right to cancel, modify, or change any permissive uses under these guidelines at any time at its sole discretion.

*   If you’ve found a website that uses a Twitch Brand Asset inappropriately, we’d like to hear about it, please report to [legal@twitch.tv](mailto:legal@twitch.tv).
