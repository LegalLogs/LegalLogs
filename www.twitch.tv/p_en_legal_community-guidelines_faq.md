Community Guidelines Frequently Asked Questions
===============================================

#### What does Twitch consider hateful conduct?

Hateful conduct is any content or activity that promotes, encourages, or facilitates discrimination, denigration, objectification, harassment, or violence based on the following characteristics, and is strictly prohibited:

*   Race, ethnicity, or national origin
*   Religion
*   Sex, Gender, or Gender Identity
*   Sexual Orientation
*   Age
*   Disability or Medical Condition
*   Physical Characteristics
*   Veteran Status

Twitch will consider a number of factors to determine the intent and context of any reported hateful conduct. You can read more on Twitch’s harassment and hateful conduct policies in our [Learn More article.](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/)  

#### What do I do about people being harassing or hateful in my chat while I’m offline or AFK?

We ask that streamers make a good faith effort to moderate their chat with tools like AutoMod, building a moderation team, and/or by utilizing the numerous third party tools available.

So long as you are not turning a blind eye to content or conduct that violates the Community Guidelines, you should feel confident that no punitive actions will be taken on your channel.

#### What should I do about viewers exploiting elements of my stream like text-to-speech to harass, be hateful, or post sexual content?

As a streamer, you are responsible for the content on your stream. Twitch asks you to make a good faith effort to moderate interactive elements of your stream such as setting a word filter or a notification delay to give yourself a chance to moderate incoming notifications. Ultimately, you will have to decide what steps are right for your stream and your community’s behavior in order to abide by the Community Guidelines. Remember to temporarily disable or mute any unmoderated interactive elements such as text-to-speech if you step away from your computer.

#### To what extent am I responsible for my community?

Creators are role models and leaders of the communities they create or foster around them. Creators should consider the consequences of their statements and actions of their audiences; we ask that you make a good faith effort to quell any efforts from those in your community to harass others.

Twitch should not be used to incite, encourage, promote, facilitate, or organize hateful conduct or harassment, whether on or off Twitch. We will suspend communities, organizations, and individuals that do so.

#### Why is Twitch moderating off-Twitch conduct?

We recognize that harassment against Twitch community members can sometimes originate from off-Twitch conduct. Our desire to moderate verifiable off-Twitch harassment stems from our belief that ignoring conduct when we are able to verify and attribute it to a Twitch account compromises one of our most important goals: every Twitch user can bring their whole authentic selves to the Twitch community without fear of harassment.

#### How is Twitch moderating off-Twitch conduct?

Reporters of harassment must submit links to evidence with their report.

The moderation team will only take action if:

*   The links provided are verifiable
*   The content can be directly tied to the reported Twitch user
*   The target of harassment is another Twitch user, group of Twitch users, or Twitch employees
*   The moderation team determines the conduct violates our policies

Twitch will not actively monitor other websites or services for violations of our Community Guidelines, nor will we be acting on off-Twitch content created prior to March 5, 2018.

#### What clothing is appropriate for my stream?

Given the variety of content and activities creators engage in, an explicit dress code would be unreasonably restrictive. Streaming is a public activity that reaches a global audience of many ages and cultures, and as such we prohibit nudity and sexual conduct. When evaluating reports for sexual conduct, attire is just one factor we will use in making a determination on whether conduct is acceptable.

We recommend creators wear attire that would be publicly appropriate for the context, location, and activity they are broadcasting. For example, workout clothes would be appropriate for a fitness stream and a swimsuit would be appropriate for a stream from a public beach.

Learn more about guidelines on [Nudity & Attire](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/sexualcontent/#nudity-and-attire).

#### I’m an artist and I want to paint a nude portrait not intended to be sexual. Can I stream my nude figure drawing?

As we do not yet provide sufficient tools for viewers to limit their exposure to nudity and mature content, artistic and educational nudity are not allowed. We are working on ways to make this possible in the future.

#### What about activities such as body painting and dancing?

Body painting, dancing, and other creative activities that do not violate our policies are welcome on Twitch. If flagged as potential sexually suggestive content, we will consider the context and intent of the content to determine whether the reported conduct violates our policies.

Learn more about our policies on [Suggestive Content](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/sexualcontent/#sexually-suggestive-content).

#### What is the policy on retroactive enforcement of content on Twitch created prior to March 5, 2018? Am I expected to delete everything?

Starting March 5th, 2018, all content on the site is subject to the new guidelines. We expect creators to make a good faith effort to remove any hateful, harassing, and sexually suggestive content from their channel.

However, if reported, content that violates the new guidelines and that was created before the new guidelines come into effect will be removed without suspension, but we reserve the right to exercise discretion on severe violations. For information about how to review and delete individual Clips and VODs, check out their respective help.twitch.tv articles: How to Manage Clips & VOD on Twitch.

#### Do I need to be the target of a hateful comment or harassment to report a user?

No. Sometimes an individual target of this behavior may not be aware of the harassment at the time it takes place or may be unable to submit a report. Sometimes hateful comments may not be directed at any one person, but rather at groups of people. Regardless of your level of involvement, hateful conduct and harassment in violation of our Community Guidelines can be reported if observed taking place.

#### Do I have to have to communicate a behavior is undesired for it to be considered harassment and report the user?

No, however in some contexts, content or activity that appears to be harassing may be unintentional and, upon being told their actions are making others uncomfortable, the user may correct their behavior. You may also decide that some forms of harassment are severe enough to warrant reporting without first communicating they are unwanted. If you feel it is safe and appropriate to do so, we recommend you clearly communicate the conduct is unwanted.  If the unwanted behavior persists, we recommend you report the user and consider other options to manage the situation such as blocking the user’s account(s) or banning them from chat.

#### I accidentally showed content that was sexually explicit. Will my account be suspended?

As owner of your account, it’s entirely your responsibility to ensure that anything shared on your account abides by Twitch’s Terms of Service (ToS) and Community Guidelines (CG). If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast breaks these, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast. Content that breaks ToS or CG, whether shown accidentally or on purpose, can be reported and moderation may take appropriate action on that content, including removing the content and issuing on a suspension on your account. Given the nature of live content, we expect you to take proper precautions; even one incident may warrant action.

#### Why aren’t there specific rules about what clothing is and isn’t allowed on Twitch?

As Twitch continues to expand the variety of content we feature, so comes the need for updating the range of attire that is acceptable. For example, something that is acceptable for a broadcast at the beach or the gym may not be acceptable for a cooking or gameplay broadcast. In an effort to help creators abide by our Community Guidelines in the same way they would expectations of behavior in the real world, we’ve updated our policies to reflect that we will consider not just the attire itself, but also the contextual setting in which it is worn and the intent of the person wearing it, when moderating content. Please remember that sexually explicit or suggestive content, such as nudity exposing or focusing on genitals, buttocks, or nipples, and attire intended to be sexually suggestive are prohibited.

#### What about subscriber emotes?

Above Twitch’s [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines), all subscriber emotes are subject to additional policies detailed in the [Subscriber Emoticon Guide](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2348985). Please keep in mind subscriber emotes aren’t just for use or present on their respective Partner or Affiliate channels; subscriber emotes can be used globally across Twitch services, so these guidelines may be more restrictive. Read the [Emote Guidelines](https://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/2348985#guidelines) section to ensure that you understand all of the guidelines that determine what is and is not allowed when it comes to emotes.
