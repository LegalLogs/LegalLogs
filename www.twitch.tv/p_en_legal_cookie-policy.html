<h4 id="what-is-a-cookie"><strong>What is a Cookie?</strong></h4>

<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device. They are widely used in order to make websites and software applications work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites and software applications can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize a particular device and remember important information that will make your use of a website or software application more convenient (e.g., by remembering your user preferences).</p>

<h4 id="what-cookies-do-we-use-and-why-do-we-use-them"><strong>What Cookies do we use and why do we use them?</strong></h4>

<p>Below we list the different types of cookies we may use on the Twitch Services.</p>

<p>We use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) and persistent cookies (that last until you delete them from your browser, or until they expire in accordance with their lifespan). Twitch-originated persistent cookies on Twitch Services will have a maximum lifespan of thirteen months from the time you last used the Twitch Services. Cookies used to remember your privacy settings (such as Advertising Preferences), may remain on your browser for up to 5 years.</p>

<p>We use first party and third party cookies. First-party cookies are created and accessed by the host domain - the domain the user is visiting, in this case, Twitch. Third-party cookies are those created and accessed by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time.</p>

<p><em>Operational Cookies:</em> These cookies are critical to the operation of the Twitch Services. These cookies are used, for example, to maintain your login state and remember your preferences. These cookies cannot be disabled without severely affecting your use of the Twitch Services.&nbsp;</p>
