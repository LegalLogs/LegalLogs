<p>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of claimed copyright infringement that fully comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In addition, we will promptly terminate with or without notice the accounts of those determined by us to be “repeat infringers”.</p>

<p>Please note that under 17 U.S.C. Section 512(f), any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, may be subject to liability. Twitch may, at its discretion, share a copy of your notification or counter-notification with third parties (this may include sharing the information with the account holder engaged in the allegedly infringing activity or for publication).</p>

<p><strong>Notification of Infringement</strong></p>

<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that material transmitted or hosted on our service infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written notification of claimed infringement by filling out our webform located at <strong>twitch.tv/copyright-claims. </strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Notifications can also be submitted by providing Twitch’s Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing:</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.</li>
  <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Twitch to locate the material. Providing a link to the broadcaster’s feed and the timestamp of the particular segment of the feed at which you believe there has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate content quickly.</li>
  <li>Include a statement that:&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Twitch honors retractions of claimed copyright infringement notices from the party that originally submitted them, to the extent possible.
