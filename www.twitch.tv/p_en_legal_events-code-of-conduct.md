TWITCH EVENTS CODE OF CONDUCT AND RELEASE

#### Purpose

At Twitch, our mission is to provide the best shared social video experience created by our growing community where creators and communities can interact safely.

Organizers will enforce this Code throughout the applicable event.

#### Guidelines for Recording, Streaming, and Photography

Recording, streaming and/or photography is prohibited in designated areas, including event booths, partner lounges or parties unless otherwise indicated by clear signage or prior approval by Twitch. These locations serve as safe spots for partners, staff, and community members to interact and hold private conversations. In other event areas open to the public that are not designated as a no recording, streaming and/or photography zone, you may record, stream, take photos, or vlog; however, please be considerate of others, get permission from those who may be included in your content, and stop filming if asked. Violation of this policy by Twitch users will be treated as a violation of our Community Guidelines available at (https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/community-guidelines/).

#### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Event staff may, at their discretion, take any action they deem appropriate for any attendee that engages in unacceptable behavior, including asking an attendee to stop that behavior, reporting the attendee to security, or expelling the attendee from the event without a warning or refund. Attendees are expected to comply immediately with requests from event staff. Attendees who violate this Code may be prohibited from participating in future events. All determinations of unacceptable behavior are at the discretion of event staff, and their decision(s)  is(are) final.

Should the offending attendee have a Twitch account, Twitch also reserves the right to suspend any account or remove any related content at any time for any conduct at an event that is determined to be unacceptable.
