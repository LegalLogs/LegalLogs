            <h2 id="bits-acceptable-use-policy">Bits Acceptable Use Policy</h2>

<p>Bits are digital content (i.e., animated emoticons) that can only be purchased from Twitch. &nbsp;Twitch initially introduced Bits as a way for viewers to celebrate moments and express appreciation for others and events; we refer to this as Cheering. &nbsp;And now we have Bits in Extensions; opening-up a host of other experiences - whether throwing Bits at a growing pet to voting on a particular level to play.</p>

<p>We want to build a positive experience with Bits on Twitch for creators and their community. &nbsp;One way to do that is to introduce a common understanding of how Bits can serve the community on Twitch, in addition to identifying activities that are not appropriate with Bits. &nbsp;Publishing this Acceptable Use Policy (“Policy” or “AUP”) is a step in that direction.</p>

<p><strong>Application</strong></p>

<p>This Policy applies to any Twitch broadcaster or viewer that purchases, obtains, interacts with, or otherwise uses Bits, including Bits in Extensions. We may change this Policy from time to time with such changes effective upon posting online or otherwise providing you an updated version. &nbsp;We encourage you to review this Policy on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Your use of Bits is further subject to and governed by Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-sale/">Terms of Sale</a>, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>. &nbsp;In the event of a conflict between this Policy and those agreements, this Policy shall control. If you are a developer, your use of Bits in Extensions is also subject to Twitch’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/developer-agreement/">Developer Services Agreement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Two ground rules to orient your Bits experience. Keep these principles in mind whether you are a creator, viewer, or any other party:</p>

<p><strong>Bits are not a money instrument</strong></p>

<p>Bits are digital content intended to be purchased and consumed on Twitch, and do not serve as a currency.</p>

<p><strong>Bits cannot be directly exchanged for items or services of value</strong></p>

<p>Don’t engage in an exchange of Bits for items or services that typically are associated with a cost or value. &nbsp;Communities can gather to achieve a goal that unlocks a benefit or experience for the community (explained further below). Creators can also announce benefits in response to individual Cheers, however, in each of those scenarios, the activity does not provide a return of anything of value.</p>

<p>That said, we encourage you to do the following with Bits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Celebrate amazing moments, show support for broadcasters, and be recognized.</li>
  <li>Express appreciation for Cheering and acknowledge chat messages that include Bits, whether via overlays or other forms.</li>
  <li>Establish goals for Bits usage by the community that could unlock, or provide, community benefits or content; create leaderboards; trigger content or provide rewards to viewers for collective Bits usage. &nbsp;Several examples follow:
    <ul>
      <li>Broadcaster announces that they will replace a specific emote with a new emote if ten people Cheer 1,000 Bits in the next five minutes. &nbsp;</li>
      <li>Broadcaster announces that they will play DOTA or Overwatch depending on the votes of the community based on the number of Bits Cheered in a 10 minute span. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Broadcaster operates a voting mechanism based on Bits to determine whether to arrange a meetup for the community.</li>
      <li>Broadcaster asks viewers to Cheer for a character the broadcaster should select in Street Fighter.</li>
      <li>Developer may unlock a game skin if the community cheers a certain number of Bits within a specific time frame.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Further, we encourage you to create experiences or benefits in response to a single cheer, as opposed to a community action, such as, doing a little dance; making your avatar change color; wearing a goofy hat; eating a piece of sushi…AVOID doing something that qualifies as an exchange of something of value (read below).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the Don’ts that constitute violations of this policy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t solicit Bits in exchange for money or donations, and don’t request money or donations for Bits.</li>
  <li>Don’t provide items, or specific services, that are associated with a monetary value in exchange for Bits:</li>
  <li>Offering a hoodie, a subscription to your channel, a dinner date, graphic design services, a promise to play a specific user in a game, access to a specific VOD file, cooking lessons, or engage in a private conversation in exchange for Bits.</li>
  <li>Don’t ask for items, or specific services, that are associated with a monetary value in exchange for Bits:
    <ul>
      <li>Telling the Broadcaster that you will Cheer if the broadcaster gifts you a channel subscription.</li>
      <li>Requesting a specific pre-recorded song to be played in exchange for an amount of Bits.</li>
      <li>Asking to engage with the Broadcaster in a private chat or play in a specific game based on a specific amount of Bits.</li>
      <li>Promising to Cheer if the Broadcaster sends you, for example, a t-shirt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Selling, offering to sell, trading, bartering, or transferring Bits to other users of Twitch in exchange for (a) real or virtual currencies; or (b) any other items of value whether inside or outside the Twitch Services. Any attempted prohibited sale or transfer will be null and void.</li>
  <li>Using Bits as a bet or wager or soliciting or accepting Bits for a bet or wager.</li>
  <li>Use Bits to engage in any fraudulent, criminal or other unauthorized activity, or soliciting or receiving Bits for any fraudulent, criminal or other unauthorized activity. &nbsp;Keep in mind the Community Guidelines also apply to your use of Bits.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ads for Bits</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, Twitch may make available an opportunity to watch an advertisement in exchange for Bits. Such opportunities may be limited by third-party advertisement inventory or other elements, and Twitch does not guarantee that Bits will be available at all times or at any given time. We remind you that this AUP applies to Bits that you may obtain from those opportunities. &nbsp;As such, you should not use Ads for Bits as a means to obtain Bits to Cheer on your own channel, such as creating accounts for the purpose of using Ads for Bits. Bits are not designed as a means to transfer money. You may also not use robots, or other automated means, to obtain Bits using the Ads for Bits feature; such activity is prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>Violations of this Policy</strong></p>

<p>Any violations or attempted violations of this Policy by you (or any third party acting on your behalf) will constitute a violation of the Terms of Service, including this Policy, by you and a material breach of any other applicable agreement, and/or supplements to any applicable agreement(s), with Twitch. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, a violation may result in civil or criminal liability, and Twitch, in its sole discretion, in addition to any remedy that it may have at law or in equity, may immediately terminate permission for you to use Bits. Twitch may bring legal action to enjoin violations and/or collect damages caused by any violation of any part of this AUP.</p>

<p>Twitch’s failure to enforce this AUP in every instance in which it might have application does not amount to a waiver of Twitch’s rights.</p>
