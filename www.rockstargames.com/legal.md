---------------------

](/legal#top)

Your Responsibility to the Company
----------------------------------

[

Litigation Issues
-----------------

](/legal#top)

This Agreement is entered into in the State of New York and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice of law rules. The End User License Agreement [www.rockstargames.com/eula](https://www.rockstargames.com/eula) contains a binding individual arbitration and class action waiver provision that affects your rights with respect to any ‘Dispute’ between you and the Company, and requires you and the Company to resolve Disputes in binding, individual arbitration, and not in court. You have a right to opt out of the Binding Individual Arbitration section as explained in the EULA. Please read it carefully before installing or using any Company software or services. The Binding Individual Arbitration section shall not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your country of residence. For any disputes not subject to binding individual arbitration, you and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in New York County, New York, and to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (but without affecting either party’s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible). This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits. For example, if you are a resident of a European Union member state, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of consumer protection law in the member state in which you are resident, and you can bring legal proceedings in relation to this Agreement in the courts of the member state in which you are resident. The Company has the right to prosecute civil claims against you for any violation of its End User License Agreement, the Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or any other governing terms and conditions related to its software and services, whether for breach of contract, violation of common law rights, or violation of any applicable state or federal statute. Any violation by you of such governing terms shall constitute an affirmative defense (whether characterized as arising at law or in equity) against any claim you might assert against the Company in connection with the Online Services.

  
  

[

Termination
-----------

](/legal#top)

The Company may terminate or suspend any and all Online Services and any registered account immediately, without prior notice or liability on thirty days’ notice, or immediately for any reason beyond the Company's reasonable control or if you breach any terms and conditions of an agreement or policy governing the Software, including this Agreement, the Privacy Policy and/or the End User License Agreement. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Online Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Online Services. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.

The Company may terminate any of the Online Services for any reason at all by giving at least thirty days’ notice by email or on the website page entitled "Legal Notices" or "Legal Information" (or similar title), or immediately without notice for any reason beyond the Company’s reasonable control.

  
  

[

Miscellaneous
-------------

](/legal#top)

In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy located at [www.rockstargames.com/privacy](https://www.rockstargames.com/privacy) and the EULA, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and any and all written or oral agreements heretofore existing between you and the Company with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement are expressly canceled.

No failure or delay by the Company to enforce any rights or powers under this Agreement may be deemed a waiver of those or any other rights or powers of the Company.

The Company may modify the terms of this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion by posting a revised Agreement or, in the case of a material modification, by posting notice of such modification on the website page entitled "Legal Notices" or "Legal Information" (or similar title) before the modification takes effect.
