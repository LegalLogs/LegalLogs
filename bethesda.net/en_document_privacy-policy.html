</li>
<li>
<p>For Android devices, turn on "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting (go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advanced &gt; Ads and select/toggle on Opt out of Ads Personalization)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Custom Lists and Matching.</strong> Unless you have opted out, we may share certain hashed customer list information (such as your name, email address and other contact information) with third parties such as Facebook and Google so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services. These third parties use the personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we submit with other third-party advertisers.

<p><strong>Do We "Sell" Personal Information?</strong> The CCPA defines a "sale" as disclosing or making available to a third party personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation from such third parties, we do disclose or make available certain categories of personal information to third parties in order to receive certain services or benefits from them, such as when we make browsing history available to third-party ad companies (through third-party tags on our Sites and Apps) in order to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach Users with more relevant ads and content. As defined by the CCPA, we may "sell" Identifiers and Usage Data to third-party advertising networks, analytics providers, and social networks.</p>
<p><strong>California Residents' Rights</strong>. California law grants California residents certain rights and imposes restrictions on particular business practices as set forth below.</p>
<p><strong>Do-Not-Sell</strong>. California residents have the right to opt-out of our sale of their personal information. We do not sell personal information about residents who we know are younger than 16 years old. As noted above, you may opt out of "sales" (via third-party cookies) on our websites and online games here:</p>
<p><a href="#" class="optanon-toggle-display">Cookie Settings</a></p>
<p>You can opt-out in our mobile games by adjusting your iOS or Android device privacy settings, as explained above, in Section 6. Interest-based Advertising. In certain of our mobile games you may also opt-out through the in-app settings (accessible from the main menu) for that game.</p>
<p><strong>Requests to Delete</strong>. Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the right to, at no charge, request deletion of their personal information that we have collected about them and to have such personal information deleted, except where an exemption applies.</p>
<p><strong>Request to Know</strong>. California residents have the right to request and, subject to certain exemptions, receive a copy of the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about them in the prior 12 months and to have this delivered, free of charge, either (a) by mail or (b) electronically in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily useable format that allows the individual to transmit this information to another entity without hindrance. California residents also have the right to request that we provide them certain information about how we have handled their personal information in the prior 12 months, including the:</p>
<ul>
<li>categories of personal information collected;</li>
<li>categories of sources of personal information;</li>
<li>business and/or commercial purposes for collecting and selling their personal information;</li>
<li>categories of third parties/with whom we have disclosed or shared their personal information;</li>
<li>categories of personal information that we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose; and</li>
<li>categories of third parties to whom the residents' personal information has been sold and the specific categories of personal information sold to each category of third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>California residents may make a Request to Know up to twice every 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Submitting Requests to Know and Delete</strong>. Requests to Know and Requests to Delete may be submitted online or by email:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bethesda Users: <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=711&amp;cat=1220">https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=711&amp;cat=1220</a></li>
<li>Elder Scrolls Online: <a href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com/app/incident/?category=1220">https://help.elderscrollsonline.com/app/incident/?category=1220</a></li>
<li>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@support.zenimax.com">privacy@support.zenimax.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you submit a request to know or a request to delete, we will take steps to verify your request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. You must complete all required fields on our webform (or otherwise provide us with this information via the above email address) and verify your access to the registered email address for your account, in order to verify your request. In some cases, we may request additional information in order to verify your request or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to adequately verify a request, we will notify the requestor. Authorized agents may initiate a request on behalf of another individual by contacting us in writing at the contact information set forth above, in Section 13. Contact Details; authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization and we may also require that the relevant consumer directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent. We will respond to verifiable requests received from California residents as required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination</strong>. The CCPA prohibits discrimination against California residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA. Discrimination may exist where a business denies or provides a different level or quality of goods or services, or charges (or suggests that it will charge) different prices, rates, or penalties on residents who exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the residents' data.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Incentives</strong>. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentives offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent. Where we offer any financial incentives under the CCPA, we will notify you in advance of the material terms of such incentives and your related rights, before we obtain your consent to such incentives.</p>
