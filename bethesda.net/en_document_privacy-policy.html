third-party websites, services, products or mobile applications
maintained by other companies, which are linked to from our Services.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate and Non-Identifiable Information.</strong> Notwithstanding anything
else in this Policy, we may collect, use, share, disclose, and otherwise
process aggregate, anonymous, and in some cases de-identified

<p><strong>2. Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>ZeniMax collects personal information directly from Users, automatically
related to the use of the Services, and in some cases, from third
parties (e.g., social networks, platform providers, payment processors,
and operators of certain third-party services that we use). The
information we collect about Users varies depending upon the
circumstances, such as the games or other Services used.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect Directly From You.</strong>&nbsp;You can visit our websites
and use certain of our games without registering. However, in certain
circumstances (e.g., to create an account or use certain Services), you
must provide us with certain personal information.</p>
<p>The personal information that we collect varies depending upon your use
of our Services and our interactions with you. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Registration and profile information</em>: To access and use certain
Services (e.g., to register a game, access subscription-based
Services, create an account, or link certain accounts), we may require
you to provide us with certain information including your name,

parties like payment processors and fulfillment partners to process
these payments. We do not collect, receive, process, or store credit
card or debit card numbers, or other third-party payment account
credentials (e.g., PayPal). Depending upon the Service, we may receive
your username, name, email, payment type, product(s) or service(s)

of your purchase and subscription history.</p>

in-person (e.g., at tradeshows, conferences, and the like) to receive
direct marketing communications from us, including emails about game
launches, developments, and upcoming releases. If you agree to receive
direct marketing communications from us, we will collect your email
address, and we may also collect your name, preferences, and if
relevant, information about your account and the Services and other
games you use. We may also collect your name, age, email address, and
other information in connection with contests, sweepstakes or other
events or activities on our websites and social media channels.</p>

information about current, former and prospective vendors, business
partners, and others with whom we have a business relationship.

For example, you may be able to log in to or link to certain Services

able to subscribe to certain Services, make game-related purchases,
download applications, updates, and other Services, and earn rewards
(subject to applicable program terms) from us through Third-Party
Platforms. You may also be able to access certain games and other
Services or interact with us and others about the Services through
Third-Party Platforms, without logging in to our Services or
registering with us. In each of these circumstances, we may receive
certain personal information from these Third-Party Platforms, subject
to their respective policies and terms—for example, if you play a game

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These Third-Party Platforms may also collect information about your

<li>
<p><em>Third-party tools</em>: We may use third-party tools to help us manage
and analyze our social media presence and report on comments,
mentions, and other content that is posted about us and our Services
on third-party social media sites and other public channels and
forums. How your information may be shared and accessed from these
third-party social media sites and other public channels and forums is
subject to their respective privacy policies and terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vendors and providers</em>: We may engage vendors and work with other
partners to provide services to us or to Users on our behalf (such as
payment processors, digital storefronts, cloud hosting, and service
providers). In addition, we may receive personal information from ad
networks, analytics providers, and others who we work with to deliver,
improve, and measure our online advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information We Collect About Your Usage and Activities.</strong>&nbsp;We collect
personal information about how you use the Services and interact with us
and others, such as information we collect automatically (e.g., using
cookies and pixel tags), as well as information we derive about you and
your use of the Services (e.g., when you play our games). Such
information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>User IDs</em>: We assign each account holder a unique user identifier,
which we use to identify and link relevant information to your
activities within the Services (e.g., in-game information such as
statistics, scores, achievements, and subscription levels). Some of
our games also may allow Users to play without creating an account
and/or registering with us. In such cases, we may assign you a guest
user ID so that we can keep track of your game play, scores, stats,
purchasing data, and usage data for your current and future sessions.
If you later decide to register or create an account with us, we may
associate your guest user ID and the data from your guest session(s)
with your account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Activities, stats, friends and preferences</em>: We collect usage and
preference details related to your use of the Services, such as
language, in-game purchases, game-play statistics, scores, persona,
characters, achievements, rankings, time spent playing, click paths,
game profile, preferences, friends (including friend relationships
through, for example, the creation of clans), and other data that you
provide to us as part of your account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Other information</em>: We also may automatically or indirectly collect
information about you, your computer or mobile device (such as when
you use our Services, read our emails, or interact with our social
media channels). We (and our third-party providers) may record log
files and use cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, java script,
and other mechanisms to collect this information about you. For more
information, see <u>Section 5. Cookies, Analytics, and
Personalization</u>. In addition, we may collect location information

<p><strong>5. Cookies, Analytics, and Personalization</strong></p>
<p>We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags,
JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to
automatically collect and record information about your browsing
activities, gaming performance, and use of the Services. We may combine
this “activity information” with other personal information we collect
about you. Generally, we use this activity information to understand how
our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our
Services, establish matchmaking, verify account credentials, allow
logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well
as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and
for analytics purposes (see <u>Section 12. User Rights and Choices</u>
for information about opting in or out of certain uses of your personal
information).</p>
<p>Below is a summary of these activities. For more detailed information

<p><strong>Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags, and Web Beacons.</strong> These are tiny graphics
with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, to understand
how Users navigate through and use our Services and to personalize

been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our
communications.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention.</strong> Providing a fair gameplay
environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account
stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when using
our Services. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may
use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other
technologies. When you use our Services, such technologies may create a
machine “fingerprint” or “hash” of your machine components, and collect

as “<strong>targeting cookies</strong>”) to collect activity information within our
Services (as well as on third-party sites and services), as well as IP
address, location information, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs,

of such ads and content. See our Cookie Policy
(<a href="https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy">https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy</a>) for more details about
the third-party ad companies we work with and first- and third-party
tags used on the Services and on third-party sites and apps.</p>
<p><strong>Preferences.</strong>&nbsp;We make available multiple ways for you to manage your
preferences regarding targeting cookies, advertising, and
personalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Our websites</em>: You can review or change your preferences for
targeting cookies and tags on our websites by adjusting your cookie
settings:<br>
Cookie Settings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mobile</em>: Some of our mobile games and apps may include third-party
advertising and analytics. You can opt out of targeted advertising
from third parties in our mobile games by adjusting your device
privacy settings (please refer to your device settings for more
information). This means that you will no longer get targeted ads;
however, you may still receive contextual or general ads.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition, certain of our mobile games include analytics,
advertising, and related personalization that you can opt out of
through in-app settings for that game (you can access this setting
from the main menu of such mobile games).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Industry ad choice programs</em>: You can also control how participating
third-party ad companies use the information that they collect about
your visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications, and
those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted
advertising to you; for more information and to opt out of receiving
targeted ads from participating third-party ad networks go to:</p>

</ul>
<p>Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being
served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or “contextual”
ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on
other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above
programs.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Lists and Matching.</strong>&nbsp;Subject to applicable law, we may share
certain customer list information (such as your email address or other
contact information, which in most cases is hashed when it is shared)
with third parties so that we can better target ads and content to our
Users, and others with similar interests, within their services and
other third-party platforms and services. These third parties use the
personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce
their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we
submit to target ads for third parties. You may opt out of this as set
forth in <u>Section 12. User Rights and Choices</u>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Third-Party Links and Features</strong></p>

<p>In addition, our Services may include or incorporate social media and
other third-party features (e.g., widgets, buttons, and plugins), which
are operated by third parties, such as Facebook, Steam, Twitch, Twitter,
Instagram, YouTube, and others. These features are hosted by the
respective third-party operator even though they appear on our Services,
and the third party may collect your IP address, URL, date and time
stamp, browser details, and the like, subject to their own privacy
policies.</p>
<p><strong>8. User Generated Content</strong></p>
<p>You may choose to disclose information (including personal information)
about yourself in the course of contributing user-generated content to
Services such as forums, chats, in-game messaging, sweepstakes, and
contests. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is
unencrypted public information, and may be accessed by members of the
public, who are not subject to this Policy. In addition, when you enter
certain public areas of our Services, your username and other public
profile information may be viewable by others. You should have no

physical measures to protect against possible breaches of our Services

Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, ZeniMax cannot and
does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or
other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your
