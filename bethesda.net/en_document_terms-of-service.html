<h2 class="">Services; Your Account(s); Photosensitivity and Virtual Reality Warnings</h2>

</ol>
<p>ZeniMax offers a range of services on PC, Mac, consoles, and mobile devices, including, but not limited to, the following services: (i) games and other products or services that You download, install, or simply play online as a service (sometimes referred to as "games as a service" or "GaaS"), including, but not limited to, ZeniMax's computer, mobile, and console entertainment software game(s) (collectively, "<strong>Game(s)</strong>"), (ii) access to Content (defined in Section 2), including, but not limited to, digital goods (such as wallpaper and character outfits), in-Game consumables, Downloadable Content (as defined below) and other digital items, (iii) software, including, but not limited to, third-party software and small amounts of code that might be necessary to facilitate playing online Games that are provided by ZeniMax as a service offering (collectively, " <strong>Software</strong>"), and (iv) related services, such as Membership programs that include special benefits for members, downloading and uploading media, forums, and additional features (together with Content, Games and Software collectively referred to as " <strong>Services</strong>").  For purposes of these Terms of Service, references to a "Game" include, unless the context requires otherwise, Content that is accessible by or used or available in the Game or that is applicable to the Game and the Software that facilitates the playing of the Game.</p>
<p>You must provide at Your own expense the PC, Mac, console, mobile device, other equipment, Internet connections, and wireless service plans to access, receive, play and use the Services.  ZeniMax does not warrant, represent or guarantee that a Service will be accessible or useable on all equipment or with all wireless or Internet service plans.</p>
<p>Certain Services may require the creation of an account (" <strong>Account</strong> (s)").  To create an Account, You must have a valid email address and be eligible to use the Service for which You are registering.  You must provide truthful and accurate information, and update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete.  During the registration process, You may be required to create a password.  ZeniMax has the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate Your Account and refuse any and all current or future access to or receipt, purchase, play, or use of Services if ZeniMax reasonably believes that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete.</p>
<p>Some Services may require creation of a user name, such as a "UserID", "Display Name", "Character Name" or "Guild Name" to represent You in the Services, and which are tied to Your Account (collectively, "<strong>user name(s)</strong>").  You may not select the name of another person, any third party's trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property, any name that could mislead other players to believe You to be an employee of ZeniMax or affiliated companies, or any name that ZeniMax deems in its sole discretion to be vulgar, offensive, or otherwise violates these Terms of Service.  Subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined below), ZeniMax reserves the right, in its sole discretion, (a) to delete or alter any user names tied to an Account; and (b) to restrict, suspend or terminate Your access to or play or use of any Service or license granted to You, for any reason whatsoever, including, without limitation, any suspected or actual infringement of any trademark or trade name right, copyright, or other intellectual or proprietary right.</p>
<p>By creating an Account, You agree that You do not own the Account, any user names created on the Account, any Content stored or associated with an Account (such as digital and/or virtual assets, achievements, virtual currency, and other Downloadable Content), or related data associated with the Account.</p>
<p>Accounts are non-transferable under all circumstances.  You have sole liability for all activities on Your Account and/or under Your user names.  You may be held liable for losses incurred by ZeniMax or other third parties due to someone else using Your Account, user name or password.  Your Account or certain features of Your Account may be restricted, suspended, and/or terminated if someone else uses Your Account, user name or password to engage in activity that violates these Terms of Service or is otherwise improper or illegal.  You agree to notify ZeniMax immediately if You suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of Your Account, user name, password, or other personal data, or any other breach of security.  We reserve the right to request and/or require You to alter Your password if we believe that Your password is no longer secure.</p>
<p>Do not reveal Your Account password to others.  ZeniMax employees will not ask You to reveal Your password.  You provide Your password only during automatic Account Services, such as during the log-in process, or if You initiate a "Forgot Password" request to obtain security questions to receive a new password.</p>
<p>ZeniMax takes certain steps to protect against possible breaches of our Services and the personal data we maintain.  However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, ZeniMax cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.  We urge You to take steps to keep Your personal data, user name and password safe, such as (i) choosing a strong password, keeping it private and changing it from time to time, (ii) logging out of Your Account and closing Your web browser when finished using a Service, as well as (iii) using multifactor authentication where offered by ZeniMax.</p>
<p>SECTION 12 OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO COLLECT DAMAGES FROM ZENIMAX IF (I) YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ZENIMAX AND (II) YOU RESIDE IN A JURISDICTION WHERE PROVISIONS EXCLUDING OR LIMITING LIABILITY ARE ENFORCEABLE.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE RESIDENT IN THE EEA, UK, SWITZERLAND, RUSSIA, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, TURKEY, JAPAN OR BRAZIL.ZENIMAX ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN GUARANTEES, WARRANTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IN RESPECT OF REFUNDS AND RETURNS, UNFAIR TERMS AND ZENIMAX'S MANDATORY LEGAL DUTIES (SEE THE NEXT PARAGRAPH) AND LIABILITY SUCH AS FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY DUE TO ITS NEGLIGENCE) IMPOSED BY THE LAWS RELATING TO THE SUPPLY OF GOODS, SERVICES AND DIGITAL CONTENT UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICES, THE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND ANY EULA WHICH THE LAWS EXPRESSLY PROVIDE MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED, RESTRICTED OR MODIFIED OR MAY ONLY BE LIMITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT (THE " <strong>STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS</strong>").  NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND ANY EULA EXCLUDES, RESTRICTS OR MODIFIES THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OTHERWISE THAN ACCORDING TO SUCH LAWS.</p>
<p>UNDER THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS ZENIMAX IS UNDER A LEGAL DUTY TO SUPPLY TO YOU GOODS, SERVICES AND DIGITAL CONTENT THAT ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU AND TO DO SO USING REASONABLE SKILL AND CARE.</p>

A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain visual images, including without limitation light patterns or flashing lights.  Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer, television or other screen, or while playing video games, may induce epileptic seizures or blackouts in these individuals.  These conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms, blackouts, or seizures in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.  If You, anyone in Your family, or anyone in Your household, have an epileptic condition, have had seizures of any kind, or seizure symptoms, consult a doctor prior to using the Services or playing any Game. If You experience any of the following symptoms while playing any Game, <strong>immediately discontinue use and consult Your physician before resuming play</strong> : dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, loss of awareness, disorientation, confusion, any involuntary movement, or convulsions.</p>
<p><strong><em>VIRTUAL REALITY WARNING</em></strong>.  If a Game provides for virtual reality gameplay and/or the use of third party virtual reality headsets and/or related equipment, certain health and safety precautions and disclaimers apply.  Failing to review and adhere to the health and safety precautions set forth in these Terms of Service, in the Game's End User License Agreement and the precautions given by the manufacturer of Your virtual reality headset or related equipment may cause damage to property, personal injury to You or others, or death.   <strong>Immediately stop playing if You feel unwell or experience any of the these symptoms</strong> : epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness; altered vision; motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation or nausea; and/or repetitive motion injuries and eye strain. Always be aware of Your surroundings when playing with a virtual reality headset.  If You are pregnant or if You have any pre-existing medical condition, You should talk with a physician to obtain professional advice before playing a virtual reality Game.   <strong>Carefully read and follow all health and safety precautions from Your virtual reality headset manufacturer before use</strong>.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), IN NO EVENT SHALL ZENIMAX BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO PROPERTY, INJURY, OR DEATH (OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR MISUSE OF A VIRTUAL REALITY GAME OR ANY VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET OR RELATED EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE OR OBJECTS IN OR AROUND THE PLAY AREA DURING GAMEPLAY. YOU HEREBY RELEASE ZENIMAX, ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET, RELATED EQUIPMENT, OR THE SOFTWARE.</p>
<p>Any use, reproduction, modification or distribution of Services, including, but not limited to, Games, Content, Software, or any other intellectual property not expressly authorized by these Terms of Service or by an authorized representative of ZeniMax in writing is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Not all features, products, or Services offered or provided are available to all persons who try to register or in all geographic locations.  ZeniMax reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product, or Service to any person or geographic area.</p>
<p>Any offer for any feature, product or Service is void where such Services are prohibited.  You are solely responsible for Your compliance with applicable laws with respect to the Services that You access, purchase, receive, play, or use.</p>

<h2 class="">Content; User-Generated Content; Downloadable Content; Game Mods; Virtual Items; Unlinked Accounts</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This Section 2 shall survive any termination of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>A. Content Generally</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Content</em></strong>" includes technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, animations, animation-style videos, content, pictures, code, files, data, characters (and items and attributes associated with characters), and all audio visual or other material appearing on or emanating to and/or from the Services, as well as the design and appearance of any websites under ZeniMax's control.  All Content made available by ZeniMax, unless explicitly identified as third party content, is owned by ZeniMax, its affiliates and/or their licensors.</p>
<p>You may not copy or download any Content from a Service unless You are expressly authorized to do so by ZeniMax in writing.  You acknowledge and agree that You shall not reproduce, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly perform, or transmit any Content for commercial uses unless You obtained the express written consent of an authorized representative of ZeniMax.  For clarification purposes, "derivative works based upon" Services and/or Content are works that are substantially similar, both in ideas and expression, to Services and/or Content.  Therefore, if You or someone else creates a work and it is likely to bring to mind either or both Services (such as a Game) and Content, then it is likely that such work is a derivative work and as such may not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>B. User-Generated Content</p>
<p>Content includes user-generated Content that You contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit to ZeniMax via a Service (" <strong>UGC</strong>"), provided that the term UGC does not include Game Mods (as defined below).</p>

<p>UGC includes Content contributed, provided, posted, uploaded or otherwise submitted to ZeniMax by any other person using or via the Services.</p>
<p>UGC also includes Content that is not Your UGC, including but is not limited to, Account personas, user names, forum posts, chat posts, customer service chats, communications, or other suggestions, ideas, notes, feedback, concepts or other information concerning the Services, whether generated at ZeniMax's specific request or despite ZeniMax's request that You not do so (such as Unsolicited Materials as described in Section 16) (collectively, " <strong>ZeniMax Owned UGC</strong>").  ZeniMax Owned UGC also includes all Content (other than Game Mods (as defined below)) that You create or develop using Content provided or made available by ZeniMax, including but not limited to Content that You create or develop that is a derivative work of the Content provided or made available by ZeniMax.  For clarity, Content and materials that are created, developed or accessible within a Game or Service using Content or tools provided by ZeniMax (e.g., Content and material created via an in Game editor and accessible only within the Game) are ZeniMax Owned UGC and not Game Mods (as defined below).</p>
<p>For clarity, ZeniMax Owned UGC does not include (i) any Content that You create or develop if such Content or if the creation or development of such Content would constitute a breach of this Agreement or any Supplementary Terms or would violate any law, (ii) any Content that You create or develop without the use of Content provided or made available by ZeniMax or (iii) any Game Mods (as defined below).</p>
<p>ZeniMax does not pre-screen UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that You and other users may contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit via the Services.  You are solely responsible for Your UGC and may be held liable for UGC that You contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit.</p>
<p>You may not contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit any UGC that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret law or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, privacy and publicity rights, unless You own those rights free and clear or have written permission from their rightful owner to contribute, provide, post, upload or otherwise submit such UGC and to grant or assign the described license and property rights to ZeniMax as described below.</p>
<p>As between You and ZeniMax, You will be the owner of all of Your UGC (as defined above).  To the fullest extent permitted by law, You hereby expressly grant (or You warrant that the owner of Your UGC has expressly granted) to ZeniMax and its licensors, licensees and designees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicensees) right and license to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with Your UGC in all formats and media, whether existing now or in the future, and You agree not to assert or enforce any moral rights or similar rights You may have which may now or may hereafter be recognized, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights, in any languages and media now known or not currently known.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or regulation, by contributing, providing, posting, uploading or otherwise submitting ZeniMax Owned UGC or creating ZeniMax Owned UGC, You acknowledge and agree that all such ZeniMax Owned UGC is the sole property of ZeniMax and You hereby assign and agree to assign to ZeniMax all such ZeniMax Owned UGC contributed, provided, posted, uploaded or otherwise submitted by You and such assignment will be effective on the date the ZeniMax Owned UGC is created.  To the extent that ZeniMax cannot claim exclusive ownership rights in such ZeniMax UGC by operation of law or pursuant to the assignment noted above, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, You hereby expressly grant (or You warrant that the owner of such ZeniMax UGC has expressly granted) to ZeniMax and its licensors, licensees and designees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, paid-up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers of sublicensees) right and license to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with such ZeniMax UGC in all formats and media, whether existing now or in the future, and You agree not to assert or enforce any moral rights or similar rights You may have which may now or may hereafter be recognized, and all ancillary and subsidiary rights, in any languages and media now known or not currently known.</p>
<p>You further grant each user of the Services a non-exclusive license to access UGC and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such UGC as permitted through the Services, including, but not limited to, Game functionality.</p>
<p>If so required under applicable law, You will enter into any agreement or undertake any action as deemed necessary by ZeniMax to effect the licenses described above in this Section.</p>
<p>IN ALL CASES of UGC under THIS section 2, EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZeniMax reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to REVIEW, remove, block, edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, with or without notice, and HAS no liability of any kind WITH RESPECT TO UGC, including WITHOUT LIMITATION when ZeniMax determines that UGC violates THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.  The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in ZeniMax's sole and final discretion.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, ZeniMax does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC or for ITS removal or FOR any failure to or delay in removing, UGC or other Content.</p>
<p>C. Downloadable Content, Achievements, and Other Virtual Items</p>
<p>Content also includes Content that is downloaded or downloadable from any website under ZeniMax's control (" <strong>Downloadable Content</strong>"), provided that the term Downloadable Content does not include Game Mods (as defined below).  Downloadable Content includes, but is not limited to, licensed rights granted, awarded, and/or provided to You to access and/or use online or off-line elements or features of certain Services as well as Game updates, unlockable Content, digital and/or virtual assets, rights of use tied to unlock keys or codes, merchandise redemption codes, serial codes and/or online authentication of any kind, in-game achievements, video trailers, Game screenshots, and/or Game-related wallpapers.  Downloadable Content also includes Virtual Currency, and Virtual Currency is subject to additional terms and restrictions specific to Virtual Currency as set forth below in Section 2(E), which additional terms and restrictions supersede any inconsistent terms and restrictions applicable to Downloadable Content generally.  Downloadable Content may be free, redeemable, and/or purchased, and ZeniMax reserves the right to change the price of Downloadable Content at any time, without notice.  Downloadable Content may only be held in Accounts or on devices belonging to legal residents of countries where access to and receipt, play, or use of the Services and Downloadable Content are permitted.  Except as granted in a Game's EULA, ZeniMax hereby grants to You a limited, non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable license to use, view and display Downloadable Content that You have properly downloaded.</p>
<p>Once You have redeemed Downloadable Content, that Content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content or for cash, other goods or services unless approved by ZeniMax or required by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1); for example, if ZeniMax downloaded the wrong Content to You, You may be entitled to a refund.  Unless otherwise specified by ZeniMax in writing and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), Downloadable Content may expire upon the earlier of (a) the closure of an Account, or (b) the later of one hundred and eighty (180) days past (i) the most recent Account login by You or (ii) the end of Your Membership for the applicable Service if such Membership is not renewed.</p>
<p>You agree that You have no ownership right or title in or to any such Downloadable Content, including, but not limited to, the virtual goods appearing or originating in the Services (such as a Game) or any other attributes associated with any Account or Services.  ZeniMax does not recognize any purported transfers of virtual property executed outside of the Game, or the purported sale, gift or trade in the "real world" of anything that appears or originates in a Service or a Game.  Accordingly, You may not sell, and You may not assist others in selling, Service(s) or in-Game items for real currency, or exchange those items for value outside of the Services.  Evidence of any attempt to redeem Downloadable Content for a purported exchange, sale, gift or trade in the "real world" will result in the immediate suspension or termination of Your Account or Membership.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that all virtual items represent a limited license right for Your personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, and limited use governed by these Terms of Service and are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from ZeniMax at any time.  ZeniMax reserves the right to refuse Your request(s) to acquire Downloadable Content, and reserves the right to limit or block any request to acquire Downloadable Content for any or no reason.</p>
<p>D. Game Mods</p>
<p>Content also includes Game Mods.  The term " <strong>Game Mod</strong>" means downloadable, user-generated Content developed or created by You or a third party using an Editor Tool (as defined below).  In certain cases, as determined by ZeniMax, Game Mods may be made available to other users of a Service or a Game and in such cases, such other users may download the Game Mods from ZeniMax or third parties and use such Game Mods in connection with playing a Game or receiving a Service from ZeniMax.</p>
<p>If You desire to develop or create one or more Game Mods, then You will be required to download from a ZeniMax website or otherwise gain access to via a ZeniMax website one or more software tools through which You may create or develop Game Mods (each such tool is an " <strong>Editor Tool</strong>").  To obtain a copy of or get access to any such Editor Tool, You will be required to agree to the terms of a separate EULA (the " <strong>Editor EULA</strong>").  If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions in any such Editor EULA and the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service, the terms in the Editor EULA will control over the conflicting terms in these Terms of Service but solely for purpose of the specific Editor Tool and not for any other purpose.  Please review the terms in the Editor EULA carefully.</p>
<p>With respect to Game Mods made available for download from a ZeniMax website or made available from a ZeniMax server, ZeniMax may, at any time and in its sole discretion, elect to remove such Game Mods from the ZeniMax website(s) or server(s) without notice to You.</p>
<p>Each Game Mod is owned by the developer of the Game Mod, subject to the licenses granted by the developer to ZeniMax as set forth in the Editor EULA.</p>
<p>ZeniMax may, but is not required under this Agreement to, validate, test, evaluate or pre-screen Game Mods.</p>
<p>ZeniMax does not endorse, sponsor, guaranty or approve any Game Mods, including without limitation Game Mods available for download from a ZeniMax website.</p>
<p>Your experience with any particular Game Mod may vary from other users' experiences.</p>
<p>IF YOU ELECT TO INSTALL, DOWNLOAD OR USE ANY GAME MODS, YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZeniMax reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to OFFER, make available, REVIEW, remove, block, edit, move or disable GAME MODs for any reason, with or without notice, and HAS no liability of any kind WITH RESPECT TO GAME MODs, including WITHOUT LIMITATION when ZeniMax determines that a GAME MOD violates THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, the EDITOR EULA.  The decision to remove a GAME MOD at any time is in ZeniMax's sole and final discretion.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ZeniMax does not assume any responsibility or liability for GAME MODs or for the removal of any GAME MODs FOR any failure to or delay in removing, any GAME MOD.</p>
<p>E. Virtual Currency</p>
<p>The Services may make use of one or more virtual currencies, either within a single Service, such as a Game, or for use across multiple Services (" <strong>Virtual Currency</strong>").  The following terms govern the use of Virtual Currency in connection with the Services.  Additional Virtual Currency-related terms may be contained in the EULA for a particular Game and, where there is a conflict between such terms and this Section 2(E), the Virtual Currency-related terms in the EULA shall govern.</p>
<p>Virtual Currency may be obtained in one or more ways depending on the type of Virtual Currency and the Service or Services associated with that Virtual Currency, including without limitation Virtual Currency that may be obtained through purchase with real currency, in-Game actions or achievements, as a part of Membership benefits, or otherwise.  ZeniMax may, from time to time and in its sole discretion, grant Virtual Currency to Users of one or more Services as a gesture of goodwill or in connection with promotions, Memberships, competitions, or sweepstakes organized by ZeniMax.  All Virtual Currency that is purchased with real currency, either alone or together with other Services or access to or receipt, play or use of Services (including without limitation payment for Memberships), shall be referred to as " <strong>Purchased Virtual Currency</strong>."  All Virtual Currency that is not Purchased Virtual Currency shall be referred to as " <strong>Complimentary Virtual Currency</strong>."</p>
<p>Regardless of the method by which You obtain a Virtual Currency and subject only to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), it has no value in real currency, and is not transferable to any other person, or returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for real currency, goods, or services.  By purchasing or otherwise obtaining Virtual Currency, You acknowledge and agree that all Virtual Currencies represent a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for Your personal, private, non-commercial use of Services governed by these Terms of Service.  Because it is a license, Virtual Currency is not property in which You have any ownership right, title, or other interest.  Any Virtual Currency balance shown in Your Account or Membership does not constitute a real currency balance or reflect any monetary value.</p>
<p>ZeniMax reserves the right to change the price for any Purchased Virtual Currency or to bundle Purchased Virtual Currency in any amount with other Services or access to other Services at any time and without providing notice to You.  You will have no right to a refund as a result of any change in the price or bundling at which Purchase Virtual Currency can be obtained, subject only to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1).  In the case of Complimentary Virtual Currency, ZeniMax reserves the right to change or limit the amount of Complimentary Virtual Currency granted as part of any ongoing or continuous promotion, to discontinue any promotion or to bundle Complimentary Virtual Currency in any amount with other Services or access to other Services at any time and without providing notice to You.</p>
<p>Virtual Currency is not transferable to, or redeemable for, any sum of real currency or monetary value from ZeniMax or any other person at any time.  ZeniMax prohibits, and does not recognize any purported, transfers, sales, gifts, or trades of Virtual Currency.  Virtual Currency will only be used by You to obtain virtual goods within a Game (e.g., durable goods that become part of Your inventory in the Game and consumable or single use items that are used and expire after use within the Game) or other Downloadable Content, through one or more Services, as determined by ZeniMax in its sole discretion.  You agree not to sell or transfer, or assist others in selling or transferring Virtual Currencies or any amounts thereof.  Evidence of any attempt to use, sell or transfer Virtual Currency in any manner that violates these Terms of Service may result in revocation, termination, or cancellation of the Virtual Currency and/or Your access to or receipt, play or use of the Services without refund and/or immediate suspension or termination of Your Account.</p>
<p>Subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1), You acknowledge and agree that ZeniMax will have no liability for the use or loss of Downloadable Content (including without limitation Virtual Currency) for any reason, including without limitation due to any activity of a third-party, such as hacking, phishing, or any other unauthorized activity.  ZeniMax may replace such lost Virtual Items under certain circumstances, in ZeniMax's sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, without incurring any obligation or liability.</p>
<p><strong>EXPIRING VIRTUAL CURRENCY FOR RESIDENTS OF JAPAN</strong></p>
<p>IF YOU RESIDE IN JAPAN the terms in this paragraph will apply.  Virtual Currency shall be valid for ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY (180) DAYS from the date on which the acquisition of Virtual Currency is recorded on Your Account.  Virtual Currency is used in order of its respective expiration date, where Virtual Currency with the earliest expiration date is used PRIOR TO any other Virtual Currency.  If Purchased Virtual Currency and Complimentary Virtual Currency are issued concurrently, Purchased Virtual Currency is used prior to Complimentary Virtual Currency. Upon the expiration of the period for which Virtual Currency is valid, such Virtual Currency will expire and have no further value.  Even if Your Account or Your access to or receipt, play or use of some or any Services is restricted or suspended in accordance with these Terms of Service, such restriction or suspension does not interrupt the period for which Virtual Currency is valid, and Virtual Currency will expire upon the expiration of such period.  If Your Account or Your access to or use, receipt or play of some or any Services is terminated in accordance with these Terms of Service, all Virtual Currency held by You will expire immediately upon such termination.  ZeniMax may limit the amount of Virtual Currency that You can purchase, hold, or use within a certain period.</p>
<p>F. Unlinked Accounts</p>

To the extent ZeniMax in its sole discretion permits You to download or play a Game without having an Account or without linking that Game to Your Account (including without limitation enabling You to purchase, receive, or download any Downloadable Content (including without limitation any Virtual Currency) for such Game), then if You purchase, receive or download Downloadable Content using a device that is not linked to an Account, and Your device is lost, stolen or damaged or Your device or data is hacked, then such Downloadable Content as well as Your UGC, game settings, data, in-game achievements and in-game purchases will be lost and ZeniMax will not be able to and ZeniMax will not restore such Downloadable Content or Your UGC, game settings, data, in-game achievements or in-game purchases.

<h2 class="">Paid Services</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Services require payment of a fee.  You must pay the then-current applicable fees to access, play, participate in, or receive those Services, and You may be required to have an Account.</p>
<p>For information about fees for particular Services, including Membership fees, You should visit the particular Service's product web page, contact Customer Service at help.bethesda.net or, if applicable, consult with the Reseller (as defined below) of the Services.</p>
<p>The fees displayed for Services are subject to change at any time and from time to time without notice except as set out below.</p>
<p>You might purchase Services from ZeniMax or from one or more of ZeniMax's authorized resellers.  The ZeniMax authorized resellers include, without limitation (i) the reseller(s) of Services offered on <strong>Bethesda.net</strong> or requiring a <strong>Bethesda.net</strong> account, (ii) console manufacturers, and (iii) other authorized resellers (collectively (i) – (iii), " <strong>Resellers</strong>").</p>
<h2 class=""></h2>
<p>If You purchase Services from a Reseller, then (a) You will be making payments to such Reseller for such Services and (b) the fees for the Services and the applicable payment terms will be established by the Reseller.</p>
<p>In connection with payments made to Resellers, the Resellers will collect personal data from You, including without limitation credit card, debit card and other payment information.  Your disclosure of information to a Reseller and Your purchases of Services from a Reseller will be subject to the Reseller's terms of service and Privacy Policy (collectively, the " <strong>Reseller Terms</strong>").  The Reseller Terms are in addition to these Terms of Service and the ZeniMax Privacy Policy.  For clarity, these Terms of Service will apply to all such Services as if such Services had been purchased from ZeniMax.  The Reseller Terms do not modify or amend these Terms of Service or ZeniMax's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If You purchase Services from a Reseller, then the terms below in this Section 5 (Paid Services) will <strong>not</strong> apply to such purchases.  If You purchase Services from ZeniMax, then the terms below in this Section 5 (Paid Services) will apply.</p>
<p>If You purchase Services from ZeniMax on <strong>The Elder Scrolls® Online</strong> PC/Mac Store, and</p>
<p>(i) if You reside in North America, South America, or Asia, then You will be making payments to Bethesda Softworks LLC (" <strong>Bethesda</strong>"), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware USA, or</p>
<p>(ii) if You reside in any other country, then You will be making payments to ZeniMax Europe Limited (" <strong>ZEL</strong>"), a company registered under the laws of England and Wales, with company registration number: 6333300 and with offices at Haymarket House, 28/29 Haymarket Square, London, SW1Y 4SP ( <strong>registered address:</strong> 1st floor, West Wing, Davidson House, Forbury Square, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom RG1 3EU.

<p><strong>FEES ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO THE STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART</strong>.</p>
<p>ZeniMax reserves the right to change ZeniMax's fees or billing methods at any time and, in the case of periodic fees, upon notice to You through Your Account or through the Services as set out below.</p>
<p>If You pay or are required to pay a periodic (e.g., monthly) Membership fee for a Service purchased from ZeniMax, then ZeniMax will provide You with at least thirty-five (35) days advance notice of any such changes.  Your continued access to or receipt, play or use of the Service thirty-five (35) days or more after ZeniMax provides such notice of the changes means that You accept such changes.  If any change is unacceptable to You, You may cancel Your Membership at any time (see Section 7 below) with such termination being effective at the end of the then-current Membership term or rolling period for which You previously paid, but ZeniMax will not refund any fees or prorate fees for any Membership except where a refund is required by applicable law and subject to the Statutory Obligations (as defined in Section 1).</p>
<p>If Your access to or receipt, play or use of the Services is subject to applicable governmental charges (including but not limited to sales tax, value added tax (VAT), goods and service tax (GST) or other taxes), then You must pay for those charges.  Your total price may include such governmental charges or such governmental charges may be separately identified from Your paid Service(s) fees as shown during the payment process.  Failure to invoice You for any such charges does not relieve You of the liability to pay such charges.</p>
<p>As the Account holder, You are responsible for all charges incurred on Your Account, including, but not limited to, applicable taxes, and the fees for all purchases made by You or anyone that uses Your Account, including, but not limited to, Your family or friends.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted and where applicable, for Your purchases of downloadable Games and other Services on or from The Elder Scrolls® Online PC/Mac Store, upon logging into Your Elder Scrolls Online Account, the Game or any Downloadable Content that You purchase will be immediately downloaded to You and will be applied to Your Account or the Game, as the case may be, upon purchase.</p>
<p>i. Residents in North America, South America, and Asia.**If You reside in North America, South America, or Asia and purchase Services from ZeniMax, then You must pay fees using the payment methods made available by ZeniMax for the particular Service (the "<strong>Payment Methods</strong>") and You agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each Payment Method You choose.  Payment Methods may vary by Service and the terms of Your Membership will be in Your Account details, or if You are making a purchase on a device without using an Account, such details will be provided at the time of purchase.  When You provide credit card or other Payment Method information in order to make a purchase from Bethesda, You represent to Bethesda that You are the authorized user of the credit card or other Payment Method.

You must promptly update all information to keep Your billing account current, complete, and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and You must promptly notify Bethesda if Your credit card or other Payment Method is canceled (for example, for loss, theft, or expiration).  Changes to Your Payment Method information can be made by contacting Customer Services at help.bethesda.net.</p>
<p>Some Payment Methods require or permit You to choose automatic renewal of Your Membership.  In such cases, You are agreeing to permit Bethesda to automatically charge Your credit card, bank card, debit card or other Payment Method associated with Your Account for an automatic renewal of Your current Membership preferences to the applicable Service.  You may cancel Your Membership at any time with the termination being effective at the end of the then-current Membership term or rolling period by revising Your selection in Your Accounts page, or contacting Customer Services at help.bethesda.net.  In order to sign up for automatic renewal, You must keep a valid credit card number or other Payment Method number or information associated with Your Account.  Your Membership will automatically renew on the expiration date of the then-current Membership term or rolling period at a fee no greater than Bethesda's then-current price at the time of renewal, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless You cancel Your Membership.  If You have registered for or requested an automatic Membership renewal, You agree that Bethesda may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, charge You or continue charging You on an automatic recurring basis for Your current Membership preferences unless You cancel Your Membership, which will become effective at the end of Your then-current Membership term or rolling period.  If You have registered for or requested an automatic Membership renewal but do not have a valid credit card and/or other valid Payment Method information on file and Your Membership expires, You will not be able to receive the benefits associated with the Membership (e.g., resume Game play or any paid Services usage) without updating Your Payment Method information.  Bethesda reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current expiration dates on credit cards provided by You to Bethesda.  Customers who use a third party Payment Method may incur additional payment processing fees charged by such third party to its customers, and may not be able to automatically renew Memberships.</p>

Changes to Your Payment Method information can be made by contacting Customer Services at help.bethesda.net.</p>
<p>Some Payment Methods require or permit You to choose automatic renewal of Your Membership.  In such cases, You are agreeing to permit ZEL to automatically charge Your credit card, bank card, debit card or other Payment Method associated with Your Account for an automatic renewal of Your current Membership preferences to the applicable Service.  You may cancel Your Membership at any time with the termination being effective at the end of the then-current Membership term or rolling period by revising Your selection in Your Accounts page, or contacting Customer Services at help.bethesda.net.  In order to sign up for automatic renewal, You must keep a valid credit card number or other Payment Method number or information associated with Your Account.  Your Membership will automatically renew on the expiration date of the then-current Membership term or rolling period at a fee no greater than ZEL's then-current price at the time of renewal, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless You cancel Your Membership.  If You have registered for or requested an automatic Membership renewal, You agree that ZEL may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, charge You or continue charging You on an automatic recurring basis for Your current Membership preferences unless You cancel Your Membership, which will become effective at the end of Your then-current Membership term or rolling period.

<h2 class="">Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If You reside in the EEA/UK/Switzerland/Australia/New Zealand/Turkey/Japan/Brazil</strong> , then only this first paragraph of this Section 15 will apply to You.  ZeniMax will try and solve any disagreements that arise between You and ZeniMax promptly and efficiently.  You and ZeniMax may agree to refer any disputed matter to resolution proceedings other than in a court but You and ZeniMax are not restricted from bringing court proceedings at any time.  The European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__ec.europa.eu_consumers_odr_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=1ZsH6C42INob54FVVIhW8Q&amp;r=T2MjWvlafNkdE0AQ1t5b0n65FndgmF9oEn6Dakdnf0A&amp;m=orCMEiXh8ZHowae5oCIJ4WWbxe7jiDBjM3YUDoaSqbw&amp;s=lE7GqKQsdgBzEd9R82PAdGVSxEBm4_lCMCI16xVSq28&amp;e=">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>. If you would like to bring a matter to our attention, please contact <a href="mailto:ODRnotice@zenimax.com">ODRnotice@zenimax.com</a>. We are not obliged nor willing to participate in dispute settlement proceedings before a consumer arbitration board or scheme.</p>
<p><strong>If You reside outside the EEA/UK/Switzerland/Australia/New Zealand/ Turkey/Japan/Brazil</strong> , then the terms below in this Section 15 apply to You.</p>
<p>This Section 15 facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between You and ZeniMax.  Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.  You have the right to opt-out of this Section 15 (as explained below), which means You would retain Your right to file a lawsuit and litigate Your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.  Certain of the terms below in this Section reference "class actions" or "other collective disputes or representative actions."  If You reside in a jurisdiction that does not permit class actions or other collective disputes or representative actions, such terms will not apply to You.</p>
<p>Please read this Section 15 carefully.  It provides that You and ZeniMax agree that all Disputes (defined below) between You and ZeniMax shall be resolved by binding arbitration (such agreement is sometimes referred to in this Section as the " <strong>arbitration agreement</strong>").  Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.  In the absence of this arbitration agreement, You may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions, collective actions or representative actions).  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 15 or applicable law, entering into this arbitration agreement constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this arbitration agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).  The arbitrator may not award damages disclaimed by these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Section 15, " <strong>ZeniMax</strong>" collectively refers to ZeniMax Media, Inc., its subsidiary and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.  The term " <strong>Dispute</strong>" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between You and ZeniMax regarding or related to any aspect of Your relationship with ZeniMax, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes, but not limited to, the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section 15 (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).  "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>
<p>YOU AND ZENIMAX EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL (AND NOT CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION)  ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 15.</p>
<p>A. Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.  For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give ZeniMax an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.  You must commence this process by mailing written notification to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.  That written notification must include (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) a written description of Your Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief You seek.  If ZeniMax does not resolve the Dispute to Your satisfaction within forty-five (45) days after receipt of Your written notification, You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.  You may pursue Your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p>B. Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.  Notwithstanding the above, You or ZeniMax may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute is initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (the " <strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>").  You may opt out by mailing written notification to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.  Your written notification must include (1) Your name, (2) Your address, and (3) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes through arbitration.  Your decision to opt-out will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with ZeniMax.  You are responsible for ensuring the ZeniMax's receipt of Your opt out notice, and You therefore may wish to send a notice by means that provide a written receipt.   <strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong></p>
<p>i.  Arbitration Procedures.  If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (" <strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>") either You or ZeniMax may initiate arbitration proceedings.  If You reside in North America, the American Arbitration Association (" <strong>AAA</strong>"), <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, will arbitrate all Disputes.  If You do not reside in North America, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (" <strong>ICDR</strong>"), www.icdr.org, will arbitrate all Disputes.  The arbitration taking place before the ICDR will be conducted in English before a single arbitrator.  In either case, the arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration.  The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to decide all issues with respect to Section 15, including, but not limited to whether any particular claim asserted by You or ZeniMax falls within the scope of this Section 15 and any alleged ambiguities in this Section 15.</p>
<p>ii.  In Disputes before the AAA, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, and in either instance the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.  The ICDR's rules will apply to Disputes before that entity.  AAA and ICDR rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> and <a href="http://www.icdr.org">www.icdr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules of the AAA or ICDR.  Based on the class action waiver set forth in subsection 15(B)(vii) below, under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>iii. Because the Services and these Terms of Service concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (" <strong>FAA</strong>") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>
<p>iv. Arbitration Award.  The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and these Terms of Service, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p>v. Location of Arbitration.  If You reside in North America, You or ZeniMax may initiate arbitration in either Rockville, Maryland, USA or the judicial district that includes the address You provide in Your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.  If You do not reside in North America, the arbitration shall take place in London, England or Sydney, Australia as requested by You.</p>
<p>vi. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.  ZeniMax will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon Your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration or as otherwise required by applicable law.  You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.  Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.  In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with ZeniMax as provided in the section above titled "Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution" and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>vii. Class Action Waiver.  Any arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to this Section 15 will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated or representative action or as a member of a class, collective, consolidated or representative action.     <strong>If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You.</strong>  Neither You, nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>
<p>C. Jury Waiver.  You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms of Service You and ZeniMax are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Section 15, You and ZeniMax might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that You would have if You went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p>D. Governing Law.</p>
<p>i. For residents of North America, this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States Federal Arbitration Act and the State of Maryland, USA, excluding its conflicts of laws rules and principles that would result in another State or country's laws applying to these Terms of Service (including this arbitration agreement) or any Disputes, and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>
<p>ii. If You reside outside of North America, then this arbitration agreement and all Disputes shall be governed by the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules and principles that would result in another State or country's laws applying to these Terms of Service (including the arbitration agreement) or any Disputes, and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  Local mandatory law may apply.</p>
<p>E. Severability. If any clause within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 15, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be given full force and effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 15 will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p>F. Continuation. This Section 15 shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service and Your use of the Services.</p>
<p>G. Modifications.  Notwithstanding ZeniMax's right to modify these Terms of Service, ZeniMax shall have no right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke this Section 15 (the arbitration agreement and class action waiver) without giving You prior notice and an opportunity to opt out of the alteration, amendment, modification or revocation.</p>
