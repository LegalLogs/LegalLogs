**2\. Personal Information We Collect**

ZeniMax collects personal information directly from Users, automatically related to the use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties (e.g., social networks, platform providers, payment processors, and operators of certain third-party services that we use). The information we collect about Users varies depending upon the circumstances, such as the games or other Services used.

**Information We Collect Directly From You.** You can visit our websites and use certain of our games without registering. However, in certain circumstances (e.g., to create an account or use certain Services), you must provide us with certain personal information.

The personal information that we collect varies depending upon your use of our Services and our interactions with you. It includes:

*   _Registration and profile information_: To access and use certain Services (e.g., to register a game, access subscription-based Services, create an account, or link certain accounts), we may require you to provide us with certain information including your name, username and password, as well as country of residence, email, and other contact information. If you decline to register and provide the mandatory information, you may not be able to use certain Services. We may also ask you or allow you to submit certain optional information, which may include your phone number, birthdate, location, preferences, a photo or avatar, and other profile information.
    
*   _Purchases and payments information_: If you make a purchase or sign up for certain subscription-based Services, you are required to provide your payment information, including name, billing and shipping address and details, payment type, as well as credit card number or other payment account details (e.g., PayPal). We work with third parties like payment processors and fulfillment partners to process these payments. We do not collect, receive, process, or store credit card or debit card numbers, or other third-party payment account credentials (e.g., PayPal). Depending upon the Service, we may receive your username, name, email, payment type, product(s) or service(s) purchased, and other transaction details, and we may maintain records of your purchase and subscription history.
    
*   _Marketing, contests and promotions_: You can sign up online or in-person (e.g., at tradeshows, conferences, and the like) to receive direct marketing communications from us, including emails about game launches, developments, and upcoming releases. If you agree to receive direct marketing communications from us, we will collect your email address, and we may also collect your name, preferences, and if relevant, information about your account and the Services and other games you use. We may also collect your name, age, email address, and other information in connection with contests, sweepstakes or other events or activities on our websites and social media channels.
    
*   _Your communications_: When you email us, call us, chat with us, or otherwise send us communications regarding the Services, we collect and maintain a record of your contact details, communications, and our responses. We may also collect and maintain records of the in-game communications and information that you post in chat sessions, forums, and in other areas of the Services.
    
*   _Business partners and others:_ We may collect and receive personal information about current, former and prospective vendors, business partners, and others with whom we have a business relationship. Generally, this information may include name, company information, payment and contact details, and communications records. If you visit one of our offices, we may ask you to provide certain information for health, safety, or security purposes.
    

**Information We Collect and Receive from Third Parties.** We may collect and receive personal information about you from third parties, as explained below:

*   _Third-party Platforms_: You may be able to access or connect with some of our Services through certain third-party platforms (e.g., Steam) and interact with us and others about the Services through forums and communities on third-party platforms (e.g., Discord, [https://discord.com/privacy](https://discord.com/privacy)) (each, a “**Third-Party Platform**”). For example, you may be able to log in to or link to certain Services with a Third-Party Platform account, such as PSN ([https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/privacy-policy/](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/privacy-policy/)), Steam ([https://store.steampowered.com/privacy\_agreement/](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/)), Twitch ([https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/privacy-notice/](https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/privacy-notice/)), and Xbox Network ([https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement)). You may be able to subscribe to certain Services, make game-related purchases, download applications, updates, and other Services, and earn rewards (subject to applicable program terms) from us through Third-Party Platforms. You may also be able to access certain games and other Services or interact with us and others about the Services through Third-Party Platforms, without logging in to our Services or registering with us. In each of these circumstances, we may receive certain personal information from these Third-Party Platforms, subject to their respective policies and terms—for example, if you play a game through a Third-Party Platform, we may receive your username, console identifiers (e.g., XUID and PUID), IP address, MAC address, and other identifiers and device information, and if you communicate about us or the Services through third-party forums, we may collect and receive personal information such as username, email address, public profile information, and information you post about us and our Services.

> These Third-Party Platforms may also collect information about your login and activities related to the Service and enable you to interact, chat, and share game information with other users, subject to their respective policies and terms. Each of these Third-Party Platforms is operated and managed by a third party and subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies.
> 
> **Mobile Platforms.** In addition, if you download our mobile apps or use our Services on your mobile device, we may receive personal information from the relevant app stores and platform providers, including your country/location, user ID. and other identifiers and device information. These third parties may also collect information from you as described above.

*   _Third-party tools_: We may use third-party tools to help us manage and analyze our social media presence and report on comments, mentions, and other content that is posted about us and our Services on third-party social media sites and other public channels and forums. How your information may be shared and accessed from these third-party social media sites and other public channels and forums is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms.
    
*   _Vendors and providers_: We may engage vendors and work with other partners to provide services to us or to Users on our behalf (such as payment processors, digital storefronts, cloud hosting, and service providers). In addition, we may receive personal information from ad networks, analytics providers, and others who we work with to deliver, improve, and measure our online advertising and marketing campaigns.
    

**Information We Collect About Your Usage and Activities.** We collect personal information about how you use the Services and interact with us and others, such as information we collect automatically (e.g., using cookies and pixel tags), as well as information we derive about you and your use of the Services (e.g., when you play our games). Such information includes:

*   _User IDs_: We assign each account holder a unique user identifier, which we use to identify and link relevant information to your activities within the Services (e.g., in-game information such as statistics, scores, achievements, and subscription levels). Some of our games also may allow Users to play without creating an account and/or registering with us. In such cases, we may assign you a guest user ID so that we can keep track of your game play, scores, stats, purchasing data, and usage data for your current and future sessions. If you later decide to register or create an account with us, we may associate your guest user ID and the data from your guest session(s) with your account.
    
*   _Activities, stats, friends and preferences_: We collect usage and preference details related to your use of the Services, such as language, in-game purchases, game-play statistics, scores, persona, characters, achievements, rankings, time spent playing, click paths, game profile, preferences, friends (including friend relationships through, for example, the creation of clans), and other data that you provide to us as part of your account.
    
*   _Other information_: We also may automatically or indirectly collect information about you, your computer or mobile device (such as when you use our Services, read our emails, or interact with our social media channels). We (and our third-party providers) may record log files and use cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, java script, and other mechanisms to collect this information about you. For more information, see Section 5. Cookies, Analytics, and Personalization. In addition, we may collect location information from your device if you grant us permission to do so, or derive your location based upon your IP address.

If you believe that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us as set forth in Section 13. Contact Details, and we will take action as necessary to securely delete such information.

ZeniMax may disclose your personal information as follows, and we will obtain your consent to do so when required by applicable law:

**Vendors and Providers.** We may engage vendors, agents, service providers, and affiliated entities to provide services to us or to Users on our behalf, such as support for the internal operations of our websites, online stores (including payment processors), products (such as our games), and services (e.g., forum operations and technical support processing), as well as related offline product support services, data storage, and other services. In providing their services, they may access, receive, maintain, or otherwise process personal information on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your personal information for their own marketing and other purposes.

**ZeniMax Affiliates and Subsidiaries.** Your personal information may be processed by ZeniMax affiliates and subsidiaries (“**Affiliates**”) (see [https://www.zenimax.com/legal\_information](https://www.zenimax.com/legal_information)) for purposes of (i) assisting us to market our Services and games, (ii) analytics, research, and demographic studies, and (iii) development and improvement of games, features, and other products and services by ZeniMax and Affiliates. Subject to applicable law, we may also share your personal information with Affiliates so that they may contact you about their products and services.

**Advertising and Analytics Services.** We work with Affiliates and other companies that provide advertising, campaign measurement, online and mobile analytics, and related services to us (with your consent, where required by applicable laws) and to others. They may use the information that we provide or make available to help us better reach individuals with relevant ads and to measure and improve our ad campaigns, or to better understand how individuals interact with our Services. In addition, these advertising and analytics companies may combine the information collected from us and our Services with information collected about you by them and from third-party sites, apps, and services, in order to make inferences about you and your interests, to better tailor advertising and content to you across multiple sites, apps, and services, and to collect associated metrics. For information about the rights and choices that you may have regarding the sharing of your personal information with advertising and analytics companies, see Section 12. User Rights and Choices.

**Legally Required.** We may also disclose your personal information if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes, including when we believe necessary or appropriate to disclose personal information to law enforcement, other governmental or regulatory authorities, or the courts (in any relevant jurisdiction worldwide). In addition, we may disclose the names of sweepstake and contest winners, in accordance with applicable law.

**Security and Protection of Rights.** We may also disclose your personal information where we believe doing so is necessary to protect the Services and our business operations; to prevent and detect fraud, unauthorized activities and access, and other misuse; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding actual or suspected illegal activities or fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety or legal rights of ZeniMax or any person or third party, or violations of our Terms of Service; to regularly exercise our rights in judicial, administrative, or arbitration proceedings (as applicable in Brazil); to respond to any claims against us; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ZeniMax, our customers, or the public.

**With Consent.** We may also disclose your personal information to any other affiliated or third parties where you have consented or requested that we do so.

**5\. Cookies, Analytics, and Personalization**

We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, gaming performance, and use of the Services. We may combine this “activity information” with other personal information we collect about you. Generally, we use this activity information to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our Services, establish matchmaking, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes (see Section 12. User Rights and Choices for information about opting in or out of certain uses of your personal information).

Below is a summary of these activities. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy, which applies to our sites that display or link to this Cookie Policy, available at [https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy](https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy).

**Log Files.** We collect certain activity information from log files. Log file information is automatically collected by our servers when you access our Services. We record certain information from these log files, including web requests, IP address, browser type and version, language information, referring and exiting URLs, links clicked, pages viewed, engagement data, and other similar information.

**Cookies.** These are small files with a unique identifier that are transferred to your browser through our websites. They allow us to remember Users who are logged in, to understand how Users navigate through and use our Services, and to display personalized content and targeted ads (including on third-party sites and applications).

**Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags, and Web Beacons.** These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, to understand how Users navigate through and use our Services and to personalize content. We also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.

**Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention.** Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when using our Services. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. When you use our Services, such technologies may create a machine “fingerprint” or “hash” of your machine components, and collect information about you, including information about your browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites, and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services.

**Analytics Tools.** We may use internal and third-party analytics tools (see our Cookie Policy at [https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy](https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy) for a list of third parties) to collect and aggregate activity data and other data across multiple channels.

**Preferences.** You can review or change your preferences for most cookies and tags on our websites (other than those that are necessary to the proper functioning of our websites) by adjusting your cookie settings:

[Cookie Settings](#)

**6\. Targeting and Advertising**

We work with third-party ad networks, channel partners, mobile ad networks, analytics and measurement services, and others (“**third-party ad companies**”) to personalize content and display advertising within our Services (including our websites and our mobile and other games and apps), as well as to manage our advertising on third-party sites, mobile apps, and online services. We and these third-party ad companies may use cookies, pixel tags, and other tools (which we may refer to collectively as “**targeting cookies**”) to collect activity information within our Services (as well as on third-party sites and services), as well as IP address, location information, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers; we and these third-party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content within our Services and on third-party sites and apps, and to evaluate the success of such ads and content. See our Cookie Policy ([https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy](https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy)) for more details about the third-party ad companies we work with and first- and third-party tags used on the Services and on third-party sites and apps.

**Preferences.** We make available multiple ways for you to manage your preferences regarding targeting cookies, advertising, and personalization:

*   _Our websites_: You can review or change your preferences for targeting cookies and tags on our websites by adjusting your cookie settings:  
    [Cookie Settings](#)
    
*   _Mobile_: Some of our mobile games and apps may include third-party advertising and analytics. You can opt out of targeted advertising from third parties in our mobile games by adjusting your device privacy settings (please refer to your device settings for more information). This means that you will no longer get targeted ads; however, you may still receive contextual or general ads.
    

> In addition, certain of our mobile games include analytics, advertising, and related personalization that you can opt out of through in-app settings for that game (you can access this setting from the main menu of such mobile games).

*   _Industry ad choice programs_: You can also control how participating third-party ad companies use the information that they collect about your visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications, and those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted advertising to you; for more information and to opt out of receiving targeted ads from participating third-party ad networks go to:
    
    *   U.S. Users: [https://aboutads.info/choices](https://aboutads.info/choices) (Digital Advertising Alliance) (You can also download the DAA AppChoices tool in order to help control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device.)
        
    *   EU Users: [https://youronlinechoices.eu](https://youronlinechoices.eu) (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance)
        
    *   Canada Users: [https://youradchoices.ca/choices/](https://youradchoices.ca/choices/) (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada)
        

Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or “contextual” ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

**Custom Lists and Matching.** Subject to applicable law, we may share certain customer list information (such as your email address or other contact information, which in most cases is hashed when it is shared) with third parties so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services and other third-party platforms and services. These third parties use the personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we submit to target ads for third parties. You may opt out of this as set forth in Section 12. User Rights and Choices.

**7\. Third-Party Links and Features**

Our Services may contain links to third-party sites that are not owned or controlled by ZeniMax. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by these third-party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy notice of any website you visit before you submit any personal information.

In addition, our Services may include or incorporate social media and other third-party features (e.g., widgets, buttons, and plugins), which are operated by third parties, such as Facebook, Steam, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and others. These features are hosted by the respective third-party operator even though they appear on our Services, and the third party may collect your IP address, URL, date and time stamp, browser details, and the like, subject to their own privacy policies.

**8\. User Generated Content**

You may choose to disclose information (including personal information) about yourself in the course of contributing user-generated content to Services such as forums, chats, in-game messaging, sweepstakes, and contests. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted public information, and may be accessed by members of the public, who are not subject to this Policy. In addition, when you enter certain public areas of our Services, your username and other public profile information may be viewable by others. You should have no expectation of privacy as to any information you post or display in our forums or games, or in your profile, or that you otherwise make available on or through our Services.

**9\. Security of Your Information**

ZeniMax takes reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect against possible breaches of our Services and the personal information we maintain. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, ZeniMax cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, enabling multifactor authentication (where available), as well as logging out of your User account and closing your web browser when finished using the Services.

**10\. Data Retention**

We will retain your personal information as long as necessary for purposes for which the personal information was collected and is used by us, as stated in this Policy. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide the Services to you, please contact us as set forth in Section 13. Contact Details. However, if you withdraw consent or otherwise object to our collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information, you may not be able to use the Services. Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, and enforce our agreements.

**11\. International Transfers of Data**

ZeniMax is headquartered in the United States, and has operations, entities, and service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, ZeniMax may collect your personal information from the United States, and we may transfer your personal information to, and process your personal information from, the United States and other jurisdictions where we and our Affiliates and service providers have operations.

**Rights Under California's Shine-the-Light Law.** We do not share personal information collected online with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing purposes and will not do so unless you agree to such disclosure.
