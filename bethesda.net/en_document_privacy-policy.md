**2\. Personal Information We Collect**

ZeniMax collects personal information directly from Users, automatically related to the use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties (such as social networks, platform providers, payment processors, and operators of certain third-party services that we use). The information we collect about Users varies depending upon the circumstances, such as the games or Services used.

**Information We Collect from You.** Generally, we collect your personal information on a voluntary basis. However, if you decline to provide certain personal information that is marked mandatory, you may not be able to access certain Services or we may be unable to fully respond to your inquiry. In general, we may collect the following personal information:

*   _Registration and profile information_: To access and use certain Services (e.g., to register a game, download or use a mobile application, access subscription-based Services, create an account) you may be required to register with us, by providing us with certain required information, which is identified on the registration page. Depending upon the Services you use, this may include your name, a username and password, as well as country of residence, email, and contact information; certain Services will not be available if you decline to provide required information. We may also ask you or allow you to submit certain optional information, which may include your phone number, birthdate, location, preferences, a photo or avatar, and other profile information.

We do not collect, receive, process or store credit card or debit card numbers, or other third-party payment account credentials (e.g., PayPal); this information is collected directly by these third parties. Depending upon the Service, we may receive your username, name, email, the payment type, product(s) or service(s), and other transaction details, and maintain records of your purchase and subscription history.
*   _Marketing, contests and promotions_: Users can sign up online or in-person (e.g., at tradeshows, conferences and the like) to receive direct marketing communications from us, including emails about game launches, developments, and upcoming releases. If you agree to receive direct marketing communications from us, we collect your email address, and we may also collect your name, preferences, and if relevant, information about your account and the Services and other games you use. We may also collect your name, age, email address, and other information related to contests, sweepstakes or other events or activities on our websites and social media channels.
*   _Your communications_: When you email us, call us, or otherwise send us communications regarding the Services, we collect and maintain a record of your contact details, communications and our responses.

**Information We Collect and Receive from Third Parties.** We may collect and receive personal information about you from third parties, as explained below.

*   _Third-party and mobile platforms_: You may be able to login through or connect certain third-party accounts (each a "**Third-Party Account**")â€”such as Steam, Twitch, Xbox Live, PSN and Facebookâ€”to your account with us, or to interact with us and others on game forums and communities on third-party platforms. These Third-Party Accounts and platforms are operated and managed by third parties (each a "**Third-Party Platform**"), and subject to their respective terms and conditions. When you link a Third-Party Account to use our Services, you may be able to connect and interact with and share game information with your friends and network from that Third-Party Account, and, in some cases, you may be able to make purchases through or earn rewards (subject to applicable program terms) from that Third-Party Account. When you access, play or use our Services through a Third-Party Platform or website, we may collect or receive your console identifier(s) (e.g., XUID and PUID), as well as IP address, MAC address, and other device identifiers, registered email address, and other information you authorize them to provide us. In addition, we may allow you to login to certain Services through Third-Party Accounts, such as Google/Stadia ([https://stadia.google.com/privacy](https://stadia.google.com/privacy)), Steam ([https://store.steampowered.com/privacy\_agreement/](https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/)) and Facebook ([facebook.com/about/privacy/](https://facebook.com/about/privacy/)). If you choose to login this way, you are asked to share certain information with us (which may include name, email, friends and public profile information); the specific information and whether it is required or optional is stated on the permissions page when you first log in with or connect the Third-Party Account. If you play or purchase our Service on your mobile device, we receive information about you from the app stores and other mobile platform providers, including your username and/or device ID.
*   _Third-party tools_: We also may use third-party tools to help us manage and analyze our social media presence, and report on comments, mentions and other content that is posted about us on Third-Party Platforms and other social media sites, other public channels and forums. The information collection and sharing practices of these third parties are subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies.
*   _Vendors and providers_: We may engage vendors and work with other partners to provide services to us or to Users on our behalf (such as payment processors, digital storefronts, cloud hosting and services providers). In addition, we may receive personal information from ad networks, analytics providers and others who we work with to deliver, improve and measure our online advertising and marketing campaigns.

**Information We Collect About Your Usage and Activities.** We collect personal information about how you use the Services and interact with us and others, such as information we collect automatically (e.g., using cookies and pixel tags), as well as information we derive about you and your use of the Services. Such information includes:

*   _User IDs_: We assign account holders a unique user identifier, which we use to identify and link relevant information to your activities within the Services (e.g., in-game information such as statistics, scores, achievements and subscription levels). Some of our games also may allow Users to play without creating an account and/or registering with us. In such cases, we may assign you a guest user ID so that we can keep track of your game play, scores, stats, purchasing data and usage data for your current and future sessions. If you later decide to register or create an account with us, we may associate your guest ID and the data from your guest session(s) with your account.
*   _Activities, stats, friends and preferences_: We collect usage and preference details related to your use of the Services, such as language, in-game purchases, game-play statistics, scores, persona, characters, achievements, rankings, time spent playing, click paths, game profile, preferences, friends (including friend relationships through, for example, the creation of clans) and other data that you provide to us as part of your account.
*   _Other information_: We also may automatically or indirectly collect information about you, your computer or mobile device (such as when you use our Services, read our emails, through social media channels). We (and our third-party providers) may record log files and use cookies, pixel tags, local shared objects, java script, and other mechanisms to collect this information about you. For more information, see Section 5. Cookies, Analytics and Personalization below. In addition, we may collect location information from your device if you grant us permission to do so, or derive your location based upon your IP address.

In providing their services, they may access, receive, maintain or otherwise process personal information on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your personal information for their own marketing and other purposes.

They may use this information to help us better reach individuals with relevant ads and to measure and improve our ad campaigns, or to better understand how individuals interact with our Services. In addition, these third parties may combine the information collected from us and our Services with information collected about you from third-party sites, apps and services, in order to make inferences about you and your interests, to better tailor advertising and content to you across multiple sites, apps, and services, and to collect associated metrics.

**5\. Cookies, Analytics and Personalization**

We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, gaming performance and use of the Services.

User Rights and Choices below for information about opting-in or out of certain uses of your personal information).

Below is a summary of these activities. For more detailed information about these mechanisms and how we collect activity information, see our Cookie Policy, which applies to our sites that display or link to this Cookie Policy, available at [https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy](https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy).

**Log Files.** We collect certain activity information from log files. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application to our servers when you access our Services. We record certain information from these log files, including web requests, IP address, browser type and version, language information, referring and exiting URLs, links clicked, pages viewed and other similar information.

**Clear GIFs, pixel tags and web beacons**. These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that we use to track the online movements of Users of our Services and to personalize content. We also use these in our emails to let us know when they have been opened or forwarded, so we can gauge the effectiveness of our communications.

**Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention**. Providing a fair gameplay environment is important to us. We prohibit cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity when using our Services. In order to detect and prevent fraud and cheating, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention tools, applications, and other technologies. When you use our Services, such technologies may create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, and collect information about you, including information about your browser, device, activities, game identifiers, and operating system. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services.

**6\. Interest-based Advertising**

We work with third-party ad networks, channel partners, mobile ad networks, analytics and measurement services and others ("**third-party ad companies**") to personalize content and display advertising within our Services (including our websites and our mobile and other games and apps), as well as to manage our advertising on third-party sites, mobile apps and online services. We and these third-party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools (which we may refer to collectively as "**targeting cookies**") to collect activity information within our Services (as well as on third-party sites and services), as well as IP address, location information, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers; we and these third-party ad companies use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content within our Services and on third-party sites and apps, and to evaluate the success of such ads and content. See our Cookie Policy ([https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy](https://bethesda.net/document/cookie-policy)) for more details about the third-party ad companies we work with and first and third-party tags used on the Services and on third-party sites and apps.

**Preferences.** We make available multiple ways for you to manage your preferences regarding targeting cookies, advertising and personalization.

*   _Our websites and online games_: You can review or change your preferences for targeting cookies and tags on our websites by adjusting your cookie settings:  
    [Cookie Settings](#)
    
*   _Mobile_: Some of our mobile games and apps may include third-party advertising and analytics. You can opt out of targeted advertising from third parties in our mobile games by adjusting your device privacy settings. This means that you will no longer get targeted ads; however, you may still receive contextual or general ads.
    
    *   For iOS devices, you can turn on the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting (go to Settings>Privacy>Advertising and select/toggle on Limit Ad Tracking).
        
    *   For Android devices, turn on "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting (go to Settings > Privacy > Advanced > Ads and select/toggle on Opt out of Ads Personalization)
        
    
    In addition, certain of our mobile games include analytics and related personalization that you can opt out of through an in-app settings for that game (you can access this setting from the main menu of such mobile games).
    
*   _Industry ad choice programs_: You can also control how participating third-party ad companies use the information that they collect about your visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications, and those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted advertising to you; for more information and to opt out of receiving targeted ads from participating third-party ad networks go to:
    
    *   U.S. Users: [aboutads.info/choices](http://aboutads.info/choices) (Digital Advertising Alliance) (You can also download the DAA AppChoices tool in order to help control interest-based advertising on apps on your mobile device)
    *   EU Users: [youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu) (European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance)
    *   Canada Users: [youradchoices.ca/choices/](http://youradchoices.ca/choices/) (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada)

Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or "contextual" ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

**Custom Lists and Matching.** Unless you have opted out, we may share certain hashed customer list information (such as your name, email address and other contact information) with third partiesâ€”such as Facebook and Googleâ€”so that we can better target ads and content to our Users, and others with similar interests, within their services. These third parties use the personal information we provide to help us target ads and to enforce their terms, but we do not permit them to use or share the data we submit with other third-party advertisers. You may opt out of this as set forth below, in Section 12. User Rights and Choices.

**7\. Third-Party Links and Features**

Our Services may contain links to third-party sites that are not owned or controlled by ZeniMax. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by these third-party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy notice of the website to which you link before you submit any personal information.

In addition, our Services may include or incorporate social media and other third-party features (e.g., widgets, buttons, and plugins), which are operated by third-party platforms and networks, such Facebook, Steam, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and others. These features are hosted by the respective third-party operator even though they appear on our Services. Subject to your cookie preferences, the third party may collect your IP address, URL, date and time stamp, browser details and the like, subject to their own privacy policies.

**8\. User Generated Content**

You may choose to disclose information (including personal information) about yourself in the course of contributing user generated content to ZeniMax Services such as forums. Information that you disclose in any of these forums is unencrypted public information, and may be accessed by members of the public, who are not subject to this Policy. In addition, when you enter certain public areas of our Services, your username and other public profile information may be viewable by others. You should have no expectation of privacy as to any information you post or display in our forums or games, or in your profile, or that you otherwise make available on our or through our Services.

**9\. Security of Your Information**

The security of your personal information is important to us. ZeniMax takes steps to protect against possible breaches of our Services and the personal information we maintain. However, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Thus, ZeniMax cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, such as choosing a strong password and keeping it private, enabling multifactor authentication (where available), as well as logging out of your User account, and closing your web browser when finished using the Services.

**10\. Data Retention**

We will retain your personal information as long as necessary for purposes for which the personal information was collected and is used by us, as stated in this Policy. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide the Services to you, please contact us as set forth below, in Section 13. Contact Details. However, if you withdraw consent or otherwise object to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, you may not be able to use the Services. Further, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain appropriate business records, and enforce our agreements.
