<h3>COOKIE INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We use cookies (information stored by your browser) to track information on the pages read by visitors to our sites to improve the content and offerings on our sites. Cookies are small text files that websites can send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user’s identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned. The cookies we use are “analytical” cookies.</p>
<p>They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our sites when they are using them. Read more about the individual analytical cookies we use and how to recognise them at <a href="mailto:aboutcookies.codemasters.com">aboutcookies.codemasters.com</a>. Although we cannot identify individuals from this information, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
<p>The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003, as amended by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (the "Directive"), recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of website users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used (which is exactly what we are doing here!), and to provide some information on how cookies are used.</p>
<p>You can find more information on this subject at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Lastly, the Directive places an obligation on websites to make users aware that they can set their computers to reject cookies. You can do this by activating a setting in your internet browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. You can find instructions on how to do this at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you first access our websites. However, you should be aware that our websites will not work without cookies and therefore we recommend you leave them turned on.</p>

<h3>Codemasters Accounts Naming Policy</h3>
<p>When selecting a display name for a Codemasters Account, online game, service, character, team name or object, please be aware of the following restrictions that are NOT appropriate for use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Names of historical or religious significance.</li>
<li>Common names or references to drug related substances, culture or paraphernalia.</li>
<li>Sexually explicit, defamatory, obscene, racially or ethnically offensive names or slang.</li>
<li>Globally popular registered trademark names of products, goods, materials or services.</li>

<li>Names causing mockery or imitation of any Codemasters in-game personality or character.</li>

</ol>
<p>In certain Codemasters online games, it may be possible for you to purchase a rename for one or more of your avatars via the game shop.

Should Codemasters change the name of an avatar in violation of the above policy as a result of a shop purchase no reimbursement of the purchase price will be given.</p>
<p><b>Naming Policy Enforcement</b></p>
<p>If any of your display names, or game avatars are in violation of any of the above naming rules, the Codemasters Accounts Support Team reserves the right to either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the name to a more suitable alternative. Codemasters will not engage in any dialogue regarding further changes to renamed avatars and the decision of the Codemasters Accounts Support team will be final.</li>
