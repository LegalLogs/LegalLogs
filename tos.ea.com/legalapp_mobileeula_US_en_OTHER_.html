<p><b>3.&nbsp; Third Party Ad-Serving Technology.</b>&nbsp; This Application may include third party dynamic behavioral in-game advertising technology which enables tailored advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the Application on your mobile device and replaced while you are online.&nbsp; When you use this Application, we or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use demographic or other information collected directly from you and/or from third parties such as age and gender as well as information logged and/or collected from your device using cookies, web beacons and other technologies to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Application and to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of advertising. This technology also controls the number of times you see a given ad, delivers ads that relate to your interests and measures the effectiveness of ad campaigns.&nbsp; Logged and/or collected data may include (but is not limited to) IP address, unique device I.D. and/or MAC Address, browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device make and model, carrier provider, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited, clicks on advertisements, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), game play information, general online and Application-specific usage data and metrics as well as angle of view. <b>The foregoing data may be collected, used, stored and disclosed pursuant to the EA Privacy and Cookie Policy at <a href="http://privacy.ea.com">http://privacy.ea.com</a> ((including for purposes of determining ad conversion rates), the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology and may be disclosed to other third parties in a form that does not personally identify you.</b></p>

<p>This ad serving technology is integrated into the game; if you do not want to use this technology, do not install or use this Application.</p>

<li>Origin Services</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>SCRABBLE USERS:&nbsp; SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR USE OF ORIGIN SERVICES BELOW.</p>
<p>For Applications with Origin social services integrated therein, when you establish your Application profile, your privacy settings will govern how others can search for you within the service as well as who can see your profile, which will show which games and/or applications you have and play on your device (among other items that you choose to disclose).&nbsp; When you log into the Application and if you choose to connect with friends on the Application, you agree that your friends will receive notifications about your game play activity, Application usage and stats.&nbsp; If you do not want your friends to receive such notifications at any time, you can visit your privacy settings and/or block users at any time. When you log in initially, you also agree that your friends can search for you on Origin services (both mobile and PC) using your email address, among other identifiers that you may indicate.&nbsp; You may be able to change that preference by visiting your privacy settings on your profile page.</p>
<p>Select Origin services will be available on both PC and mobile platforms.&nbsp; You can log into all Origin services using your Origin Account (formerly EA Account).&nbsp; Your Origin friends list, if you choose to have one, will be the same no matter where you log in.&nbsp; For instance, if you utilize Origin features on your mobile application, your mobile Origin friends will appear in your Origin friends list on PC when you log in and vice versa. Likewise, your Origin PC friends’ list will also appear on your Origin mobile friends’ list when you log in there and vice versa.&nbsp; <b>If you do not want friends to see your mobile and/or PC profile, including a list of your mobile and/or PC games and/or entitlements, please be sure to set your profile visibility settings to private or “no one can see.”</b>&nbsp; You can block friends and/or revisit your privacy settings at any time.&nbsp; Your profile visibility settings will remain constant across Origin platforms.&nbsp; <b>Your last communicated preference for profile visibility will govern visibility of your profile across all Origin service environments (i.e. mobile and PC).</b>&nbsp; Your email searchability settings will also remain constant, meaning that if you allow your friends to find you via email address on Origin on mobile, members will be able to find you by searching for your email address in the PC Origin environment as well and vice versa.&nbsp; <b>Your last communicated email searchability preference will apply to all Origin service environments (i.e. mobile and PC).</b>&nbsp; Keep in mind that when you log into Origin on mobile, you agree to allow members search for you via your email address.&nbsp; This preference will also apply to your Origin PC profile.&nbsp; If you do not want to be searchable on Origin by email address, please visit your privacy settings via your profile page.&nbsp; Note, however, that if you wish to turn off notifications to your friends about your game play events and stats, you must do so separately on mobile and PC Origin environments.&nbsp; On PC, you must disable chat to turn off notifications.&nbsp; In the mobile Origin environment, you must separately disable notifications via your privacy settings.&nbsp; Likewise, if you wish not to have members find you using Facebook Connect, be sure to log out of Facebook in both the mobile PC Origin environments <b>and</b> adjust your privacy settings accordingly.&nbsp; Check your privacy settings in all Origin environments often to ensure that they are set according to your preferences.</p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR USERS OF ORIGIN SERVICES VIA SCRABBLE MOBILE:</b>&nbsp; Origin Services on Scrabble do not currently have privacy settings other than email searchability.&nbsp; Accordingly your Scrabble friends will see your Scrabble game activity and statistics via their newsfeeds in Origin mobile services in other games.&nbsp; If you would like to opt out of this sharing feature, please contact us at <a href="https://help.ea.com">https://help.ea.com</a>.</p>
<p>Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about you or your children when using the Application.&nbsp; EA does not endorse the content, messages and/or information exchanged by means of the Application and therefore you agree that EA is not liable with respect to the Application in general and/or any action resulting therefrom.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all actions that occur in connection with the Origin Account (formerly called “EA Account”) you use to register and log into this Application.&nbsp; You agree to notify EA immediately of any unauthorized use of your Origin or EA Account or breach in security known to you related to the Application.</p>
<p><b>5. Consent to Public Display of Data.</b> If you participate in online services, such as online play or the downloading and uploading of content, EA may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.&nbsp; Data that personally identifies you is collected, used, stored and transmitted in accordance with EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at <a href="http://privacy.ea.com">http://privacy.ea.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>8.&nbsp; Limitation of Liability.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EA BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE APPLICATION, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT EA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.&nbsp; SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATIONS OR CERTAIN INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ACTS, OR VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC STATUTES, OR THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp; In no event shall EA’s total liability to you for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the amount actually paid by you for the Application.</p>

<p><b>10.&nbsp; Severability and Survival.</b> If any provision of this License is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision shall be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this License shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

<li><b>Binding Arbitration.</b>&nbsp; If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.&nbsp; Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.&nbsp; <b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</b>&nbsp; The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“<i>AAA</i>”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“<i>AAA Consumer Rules</i>”), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.&nbsp; Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.&nbsp; If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.&nbsp; The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.&nbsp; The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.&nbsp; You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ol type="A">
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Restrictions.</b>&nbsp; You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.&nbsp; To the full extent permitted by law:&nbsp; (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. <b>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&nbsp; If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution/arbitration provision shall be null and void.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ol type="A">
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Location.</b>&nbsp; If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.&nbsp; For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ol type="A">
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.</b>&nbsp; If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before final written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:
<p><br></p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and</li>
<li>Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("<i>the attorney premium</i>").</li>
</ol>
<p>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.&nbsp; EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li><b>Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.</b>&nbsp; The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<ol type="A">
<ol type="A">
<li><b>Changes to Agreement.</b>&nbsp; Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice of Dispute address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice of Dispute address provided above.&nbsp; By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</li>
