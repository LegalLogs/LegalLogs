### F. Legal Basis for Processing

ⓘ Depending on where you reside, we may rely on different legal bases to process your information.

Our legal basis for processing your personal information varies depending on the type of information we collect and the context in which we collect it as well as on your country of residence, as indicated when you are setting up your EA account or, when not signed into an EA Account, your location as determined by your IP address and/or your device registration country.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or of a jurisdiction where similar legal requirements may apply such as Brazil, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we rely on a number of legal bases to process information about you. We will process information about you where we have your consent, where we have a legitimate interest to do so, where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you, and/or where we have a legal obligation to process your information. For example, we typically rely on:

*   consent when placing cookies on your device on the web (through our cookie consent manager) to send you email marketing, or to deliver third party targeted advertising to you on our Services;
*   our legitimate interests to process your information when providing you with customer service support, to serve targeted marketing of our Services, for fraud prevention and security purposes; and
*   on contractual necessity to process information when you create an EA Account to enable us to provide you with our Services.

2\. How We Collect Information
------------------------------

ⓘ We use various technologies to deliver and measure the effectiveness of our Services, to serve advertisements, and to enhance your player experience. These technologies include cookies and similar technologies, as well as analytics, advertising, anti-cheat, and anti-fraud technologies.

We and third parties use technologies described below to collect information to deliver our Services.

### A. Cookies and Similar Technologies

Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We and our third-party partners use cookies and similar tracking technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, and otherwise enhance your experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences. We also offer cookie consent tools in certain regions to help you manage your cookies.

We may use tracking pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Services and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our User Agreement. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. You may opt out of certain types of tracking on the web, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser or via our consent tools, as applicable.

We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat, and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Services. These technologies may utilize the same cookies or similar mechanisms as further described below.

### B. Analytics Technologies

We use internal and third-party analytics technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.  
  
For instance, we may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Services. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating and/or network systems (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your engagement with certain features, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in Section 3 below. If you play a game offline without connecting to the Internet, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to us when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, we may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your personal and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and accomplishments), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.

Third-party analytics technologies integrated into our Services may (including SDK \[Software Development Kit\] and API \[Application Program Interfaces\] integrations) combine the information they collect in connection with your use of EA's Services with information they have independently collected over time and/or across different platforms. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of third-party analytics companies that operate in our Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at [privacyappendix.ea.com](https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/).

### C. Ad Serving Technologies

Some of our Services employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, SDK, API, and other similar technologies to deliver offers and advertising to you within EA Services as well as on third-party platforms and sites, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices to tailor offers and advertising to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or, if you express interest in a game, you may receive an advertisement later for that game or similar Services on EA or third-party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable offers to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.

These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate offers and advertising to you, to measure effectiveness and distribution of these offers and advertising, and to understand how users interact with our Services. In addition to identifiers and certain information listed in section 1(C) above, this information may include:

*   Advertisements served and the location of the ad;
*   Length of time an advertisement was visible;
*   Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement;
*   Your interaction, if any, with the ad; and
*   Advertisement response.

### D. Third-Party Advertising Companies

Third-party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an offer to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and/or across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information pursuant to their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at [privacyappendix.ea.com](https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/).

To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third-party targeted advertising, you can visit [www.networkadvertising.org](https://www.networkadvertising.org), [www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/), [youradchoices.ca](https://youradchoices.ca/), or [www.youronlinechoices.eu](https://www.youronlinechoices.eu). Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; rather, it means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.

### E. Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies

We strive to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you use our Services, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies and collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites, and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms. If you believe your access to our games and/or Services was blocked by this technology in error, please contact EA Help at [help.ea.com](https://help.ea.com/en/).

4\. Information We Share with Third Parties
-------------------------------------------

ⓘ We do not disclose or share your personal information with third parties except as we describe in this section, such as to provide our Services and to deliver advertisements.

Except as described below, we do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose personal information to third parties (as these processing activities are defined under applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act):

**Service providers.** We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence, including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), to collect or process personal information on our behalf for the purposes described in Section 3. These purposes include conducting market surveys, providing IT and related services, facilitating credit card processing, facilitating live events, sending emails, or delivering and optimizing our Services. We require that any third party use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.

**Business partners.** We may provide personal information to business partners with whom we jointly offer Services. These partners include the companies that provide the platform on which you play our games, such as Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), or others.

**Affiliates and Subsidiaries.** We may share personal information with our companies in which we have an ownership interest as is necessary for the purposes outlined in this notice.

**Advertising partners.** Through our Services, we may allow third-party advertising partners to utilize technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your use of EA's Services and your device (such as your IP address, mobile identifiers, pages visited, location, browser information, time of day). We also may combine and share such information and other information (such as your de-identified account information, demographic information, hardware specifications, and past purchase history) with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable, or otherwise of interest to you.

If you prefer not to share your EA personal information with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions on [this page](https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYCA/US/en/PC/) to change your settings.

Please also refer to Section 2(D) for more detail on your choices regarding online advertising.

**Disclosures to protect us or others.** We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity. In particular, if we receive a report that you have violated our policies (like our [Positive Play Charter](https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/charter)), we may disclose that report and other relevant information to the platform on which you play our games.

**Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.** In the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale, or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law or contract.

**Third-party plugins.** When third-party technologies or social tools are integrated into our Services, those third parties may collect information about your use of our Services. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.

**Cross-Platform Sharing.** Some of our games allow you to connect and play with friends and members of a game's community, regardless of what platform they play on. For example, someone on an Xbox could join a match with a player who is using a PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console. We call this ability to match players across platforms "Cross-Play." When Cross-Play is enabled and you play with someone on another platform, that other platform may receive your platform's ID (such as Xbox Gamertag, or Online ID of your account for PlayStation™Network) along with other information necessary to enable Cross-Play. In addition, we may provide information regarding your use of Cross-Play features to the platform on which you play our games. You can change your Cross-Play preferences by visiting the game's settings menu.

Some of our games may also allow you to continue progress on a game between platforms, as well as enable the ability for your purchases on one platform to be available on another platform. We will share your information with platforms to the extent necessary to enable these features.

Other platforms receiving your information may include Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch), Google (Stadia), Valve (Steam), Epic, and additional platforms as they become available for these features. Your information received by these platforms may be subject to their respective privacy notices.

**With Your Consent.** We may share information with other third parties with your express consent, unless otherwise described above. For example, you may agree to us sharing your information with a certain company or organization to hear about their products, services, or promotions, or if you tell us that you want to link your EA Account with another company’s services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' respective privacy notices.

5\. Where We Hold Your Information
----------------------------------

ⓘ We store and process your information in the United States and other countries where we operate. When we do this, we utilize technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to meet data transfer requirements set by various privacy laws, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation.

Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third-party agents operate. By consenting to the transfer of your personal data outside of your country of residence, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.

EA's privacy practices comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework is available on [this page](http://cbprs.org/).

Electronic Arts Inc. holds certifications under the (former) EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield which are available at [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov). When Electronic Arts Inc. transfers information from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other affiliates, agents, or service providers that are outside the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, it will do so in compliance with the 'Accountability for Onward Transfer' principle of the Privacy Shield. Where appropriate, EA, will rely on EU Standard Contractual clauses and other safeguards to enable transfers outside of the EEA, United Kingdom or Switzerland. In line with the July 16, 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the EU-US Privacy Shield and guidance from the European Data Protection Board, EA continues to assess the legal regime of the countries to which data is being transferred and, as necessary, updates measures to ensure that we provide adequate levels of protection. To learn more, visit [this page](https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYSHIELD/US/en/PC/).

6\. How We Protect Your Information
-----------------------------------

ⓘ We use a range of security measures to secure and protect your information.

Security of your information is a priority at EA and we take a range of technical and organizational measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information. Even so, please be aware that no security measure is 100% perfect. Thus we cannot guarantee the security of your information at all times. You should always be diligent when it comes to the protection of your personal information.

7\. Children
------------

ⓘ Children can play our games with parental or guardian permission. We strive to protect their online gaming experience by disabling certain features, when possible. We also give parents or guardians controls and choices over the processing of their children’s information.

Although the majority of EA online and mobile games and Services are intended for adults, EA recognizes the importance of protecting children's privacy online. We strive to follow the different minimum age guidelines set by the laws of individual countries or territories when determining the age that children can access certain features of our Services.

**When players identify themselves as being children we will:**

(1) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, when required by applicable law. For example, we allow parents to create a child EA Account on certain Services, and with parental consent EA will collect and use certain children’s personal information to manage a child EA Account;

(2) disable features in certain Services that could allow a child to share information that directly identifies them, unless a parent has provided relevant consent to us or the third-party platform on which their child is playing. For example, we will respect third-party (console) parental controls as they apply to game features that could allow a child to provide personal information in online or multiplayer games (such as through chat or user generated content);

(3) collect and use certain information for limited purposes only. For example, we may send local in-app notifications, which do not rely on collecting personal information. Also, persistent device identifiers like IP address or advertising device identifier may be collected to support our internal operations, such as:

*   Delivering the Services;
*   Maintaining or analyzing the functionality of the Service;
*   Serving contextual ads or frequency capping;
*   Protecting the security or integrity of the user of Service; or
*   Legal or regulatory compliance; and

(4) not condition a child's participation in an activity (such as gaming contests) on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. With certain Service-related activities, we may not permit children to participate at all, even if we have consent.

**Parental controls and choices:**

If you are a parent or guardian and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, please contact us via the options in Section 11. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child's account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.

If we make material changes to how we collect, use, share or otherwise process your child's personal information, we will notify parents as required by applicable law.

We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and the risks of disclosing personal information online. You and your child should review the privacy settings applicable to their use of our Services, a summary of which is available [here](https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/parental-controls), as well as our [Online Safety web page](https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/), for additional information about using the Internet safely.

8\. Your Choices and Controls

ⓘ We provide you with choice and control about our use of your information, including your ability to exercise your data privacy rights.
