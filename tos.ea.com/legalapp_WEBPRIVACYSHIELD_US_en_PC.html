<p>Electronic Arts Inc. participates in and have certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks. EA is committed to applying the applicable Privacy Shield Principles to all personal data received from European Economic Area (EEA) member countries, United Kingdom and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Frameworkâ€™s applicable principles.

To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certifications, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>
<p>EA's accountability for personal data that it receives under the EU Privacy Shield and Swiss Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, EA remains responsible under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process the personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless EA proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EA is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, EA may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
