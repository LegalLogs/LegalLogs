    The term of your EA Virtual Currency and Digital Content license starts when you acquire EA Virtual Currency and/or Digital Content, and subject to this License, ends the earlier of (1) the second anniversary of the date of purchase or award (as the context requires and applicable to each individual purchase or award) and (2) the day that your access to this Application is cancelled, suspended or terminated as set forth in this License. If you have not used your EA Virtual Currency for twenty four (24) months or more and your account has an EA Virtual Currency balance, your EA Virtual Currency shall expire and your account may be cancelled for non-use.
    

**2.    Consent to Use of Data.**  To facilitate product support, product development and improvement as well as other services to you, you agree that EA or other third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other analytic technologies to collect, use, store and transmit technical and related information regarding your device (including unique device id or UDID), Game Center ID, Game Center name, IP address, MAC address, device make and model, peripheral hardware, operating system, software and applications, including application usage data. In addition, EA and/or third parties may collect, store, use and transmit game play data, third party account authorization data, session data, browser identifiers, connection type, carrier information well as online and Application usage and other purchase metrics, statistics and/or analytics.  **Data collected by third parties will be collected, used, stored, transferred and disclosed pursuant to the third party’s privacy policy.  See Appendix A for a non-exclusive list of third parties that may collect data via this Application.**  Appendix A includes both analytics companies and ad networks discussed in more detail in Section 3, below and includes URL’s for those third parties’ privacy policies and opt outs (if applicable). For data collected by or transferred to EA, EA may collect, use, store, share and transmit this information to third parties in a form that does not personally identify you in accordance with EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com).  Further, EA operates in several countries. Personal information collected from or submitted by you through an Application may be transferred to and stored on servers and equipment located in a destination outside your country of residence. The servers and equipment on which your data is stored and processed may be owned and operated by third parties with whom EA has contracted to receive, store and process your personal information. In addition, EA and those third parties that it has designated, may further transfer, store and process your personal information on servers and equipment located in other countries. You should be aware that the data protection laws of other countries may not be the same as the data protection laws of your country of residence. By submitting your personal information through an Application, you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information as described in this section.

**3.    Third Party Ad-Serving Technology.**  This Application may include third party dynamic behavioral in-game advertising technology which enables tailored advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the Application on your mobile device and replaced while you are online.  When you use this Application, we or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use demographic or other information collected directly from you and/or from third parties such as age and gender as well as information logged and/or collected from your device using cookies, web beacons and other technologies to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Application and to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of advertising. This technology also controls the number of times you see a given ad, delivers ads that relate to your interests and measures the effectiveness of ad campaigns.  Logged and/or collected data may include (but is not limited to) IP address, unique device I.D., browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device make and model, carrier provider, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited, clicks on advertisements, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), game play information, general online and Application-specific usage data and metrics as well as angle of view.  **The foregoing data may be collected, used, stored, transmitted and disclosed pursuant to the EA Privacy and Cookie Policy at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com), the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology and may be disclosed to other third parties in a form that does not personally identify you.  See Appendix A for a non-exclusive list of third parties that may collect data about your online behavior via this Application.**  Appendix A includes both analytics companies and ad networks (discussed above in Section 2) and includes URL’s for those third parties’ privacy policies and opt outs (if applicable).  You are responsible for reviewing the privacy policies of the third parties that may collect information via this Application.  If you do not wish to review those privacy policies or if you are concerned about the information they may collect, do not install or use this Application.  EA does not guarantee that all third parties that may collect information about you via this Application have an opt out for behavioral tracking.  In addition, EA does not guarantee or warrant that opting out of behavioral tracking from some or all of the entities listed in Appendix A will opt you out of advertising entirely.  Rather, if you opt out, you may continue to receive the same amount of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.

This ad serving technology is integrated into the game; if you do not want to use this technology, do not install or use this Application.

**4.    Consent to Public Display of Data.** If you participate in online services, such as online play or the downloading and uploading of content, EA may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.  Data that personally identifies you is collected, used, stored and transmitted in accordance with EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com).

**5.    Termination.** This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate immediately and automatically without any notice from EA if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this License. Promptly upon termination, you must cease all use of the Application and destroy all copies of the Application in your possession or control.  Termination will not limit any of EA’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. Sections 1(E), 2 through 15, and any Supplemental Terms of this License shall survive termination or expiration of this License for any reason.

**6.    Disclaimer of Warranties.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WITHOUT PERFORMANCE ASSURANCES OR GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, AND YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE ENTIRE RISK OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE RESIDES WITH YOU. EA AND EA’S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY “EA” FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION AND SECTION 9) DO NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND WARRANTIES (IF ANY) ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE.  EA DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLICATION; THAT THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT THE APPLICATION WILL INTEROPERATE OR BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER APPLICATION; THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE APPLICATION WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR REINSTALLS TO THE SAME OR MULTIPLE DEVICES. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE PROVIDED BY EA, APPLE OR ANY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATIONS ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**7.    Limitation of Liability.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EA BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE APPLICATION, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT EA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATIONS OR CERTAIN INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ACTS, OR VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC STATUTES, OR THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  In no event shall EA’s total liability to you for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the amount actually paid by you for the Application.

**8.    Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties are Material Terms of this License.** You agree that the provisions in this License that limit liability are essential terms of this License.

**9.    Severability and Survival.** If any provision of this License is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision shall be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this License shall continue in full force and effect.

**10.    U.S. Government Restricted Rights.** If you are a government end user, then this provision applies to you.  The Application provided in connection with this License has been developed entirely at private expense, as defined in FAR section 2.101, DFARS section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and DFARS section 252.227-7015 (or any equivalent or subsequent agency regulation thereof), and is provided as “commercial items,” “commercial computer Application” and/or “commercial computer Application documentation.”  Consistent with DFARS section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, and to the extent required under U.S. federal law, the minimum restricted rights as set forth in FAR section 52.227-19 (or any equivalent or subsequent agency regulation thereof), any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure or distribution thereof by or for the U.S. Government shall be governed solely by this License and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this License.

**11.    Injunctive Relief.** You agree that a breach of this License will cause irreparable injury to EA for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and EA shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.

**12.    Governing Law.** If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this License and your use of the Application; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this License and/or your use of the Application shall be the Courts of England, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.  If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this License and/or your use of the Application; and (ii) you expressly agree that, to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 14, below, jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this License and/or your use of the Application shall be the federal or state courts that cover San Mateo County, California, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.  Please note that your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.  The parties agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) shall not apply to this License or to any dispute or transaction arising out of this License.

**13.    Export.** You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and agree not to transfer the Application to a foreign national or national destination, which is prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government authorization. You certify that you are not a person with whom EA is prohibited from transacting business under applicable law.

**14.    Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration.**

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

2.  Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at [https://help.ea.com](https://help.ea.com).  **In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Switzerland, Russia and the Member States of the European Union.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  It covers any and all disputes between us (“_Disputes_”), including without limitation:**

1.  claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
2.  claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
3.  claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
4.  claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.

The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:

1.  a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;
2.  a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;
3.  In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.

**By entering into this Agreement, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.**  With respect to this Section 16, References to "EA," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior agreements between us.  This EULA evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this EULA.

9.  **Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.**  You and EA agree to first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally before initiating arbitration.  Such negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("_Demand_").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.

12.  **Binding Arbitration.**  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.**  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“_AAA_”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“_AAA Consumer Rules_”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org).  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

15.  **Restrictions.**  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law:  (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. **YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution/arbitration provision shall be null and void.

18.  **Location.**  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

21.  **Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.**  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before final written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:
    
    1.  Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and
    2.  Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("_the attorney premium_").
    
    The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
    
    The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.
    

24.  **Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.**  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

27.  **Changes to Agreement.**  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice of Dispute address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice of Dispute address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

**15.    Entire Agreement.**  This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and EA with respect to the Application and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless made in writing and signed by EA.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this License shall govern.

**Supplemental Terms**

These terms supplement and are in addition to the terms of the License for users who purchase and/or install the Application on Apple, Inc. (”_Apple_”) MAC machines and/or products (collectively, ”_Apple Devices_”):

2.

8.  In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Application to you.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Application.

11.  Apple shall not be responsible for any claims by you or any third party relating to your possession and/or use of the Application, including but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection laws or similar legislation; and (iv) claims by any third party that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes on the intellectual property rights of the third party.

14.  You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

17.  You agree to comply with applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Application.

19.  You agree that Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this License and that upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.
