Purchase of an EA Play subscription on one Platform does not enable a user to access the EA Play services on another platform. After cancellation, you can continue to play until the end of the current subscription period.  
  
Conditions, limitations and exclusions may apply. Availability of member benefits and Play List titles may vary by platform and territory and may change from time to time. Certain titles may not be available to some players because of age rating restrictions. See [www.ea.com/ea-play](https://www.ea.com/ea-play) for details.

Payment method may be required to participate. After the free trial period, the selected EA Play monthly, annual or other time period membership fee will be billed.

When your EA Play subscription or any trial ends, you will no longer have access to the membership benefits, including Play List titles, game upgrades, or in-game purchases made in a Play List title, unless you separately have access to that Play List title for the applicable Platform. Recurring rewards offered are by title and require an active EA Play subscription and game installed from The Play List on the last day of the month for the next recurring reward to be available in-game the following month. Content benefits are not guaranteed, and may be switched, added or removed at any time. **Member 10% Discounts:** excludes Star Wars: The Old Republic, certain partner titles distributed by EA, game time codes and subscriptions on PC.
