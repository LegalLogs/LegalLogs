<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section2"></a>2. How We Collect Information</span></h2>
We and third parties use technologies described below to collect information to deliver our Services.<br>
<ol style="font-weight: bold; color: #003366; list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
<li>Cookies and Similar Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Cookies are small text files stored on your Internet browser. We use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand things like what web pages, features, or ads you view and what games you play. This information helps us keep track of your shopping cart, measure the effectiveness of our advertising, make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly, and otherwise enhance your player experience. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to guidance provided by your individual web browser if you'd like help in managing your cookie preferences. We also offer cookie consent tools in certain regions to help you manage your cookies.<br><br>We may use tracking pixels or clear GIFs to collect information about your use of our Services and your response to our marketing emails. We use Internet log files (which contain technical data such as your IP address) to monitor traffic on our Services, troubleshoot technical problems, detect and prevent fraud, and enforce our User Agreement. We currently do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. You may opt out of certain types of tracking on the web, including certain analytics and tailored advertising by changing the cookie settings in your browser or via our consent tools.<br><br>We also use Analytics, Advertising, Anti-Cheat, and Anti-Fraud technologies in our Services. These technologies may utilize the same cookies or similar mechanisms as further described below.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Analytics Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">We use internal and third-party analytics technologies to collect information about how you use our Services, your computer or device and the health of our Services.<br><br>For instance, EA may collect and store data from your computer or device when you use our Services. This information includes technical and related information about your computer or device and operating system (such as IP Address and device ID), information about your engagement with certain feature, gameplay and usage statistics, system interactions and peripheral hardware for purposes described in Section 3 below. If you play a game offline without connecting to the Internet, this data will be stored on your device and transmitted to EA when your device connects to the Internet. If you participate in online Services, EA also may collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display your persona and/or statistical data regarding your game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.<br><br>Third-party analytics technologies integrated into our Services may combine the information they collect in connection with EA's Services with information they have independently collected over time and across different platforms. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of third-party analytics companies that operate in our Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/">privacyappendix.ea.com</a>.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Ad Serving Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Some of our Services employ ad serving technologies that use cookies, clear GIFs, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other similar technologies to deliver offers to you. Some of these technologies can sync or connect behavior across different websites, mobile apps and devices to tailor offers to your interests. For instance, you may be presented with an offer for a game we think you might enjoy. Or, if you express interest in a game, you may receive an advertisement later for that game or similar Services on EA or third-party sites. Other in-game advertising technologies enable offers to be temporarily uploaded to your game, web browser, or mobile device and later replaced while you are online.<br><br>These technologies collect and use information so we can serve appropriate offers to you as well as measure effectiveness of these offers. In addition to identifiers, this information includes:<br><br></span>
<ul style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000; font-family: calibri;">
<li>Advertisements served and the location of the ad;</li>
<li>Length of time an advertisement was visible;</li>
<li>Domain type, IP address, size of the advertisement; and</li>
<li>Advertisement response.<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">Third-party advertising companies may combine the information collected in the context of delivering an offer to you via our Services with other information they have independently collected over time and across different websites. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. A list of ad serving companies that operate their own networks on our Services as well as how to opt out to the extent applicable can be found at <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYAPPENDIX/US/en/PC/">privacyappendix.ea.com</a>.<br><br>To learn more about some of these ad networks' practices, or to opt out of third-party targeted advertising, you can visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>, <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/">youradchoices.ca</a>, or <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.eu">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>. Note that opting out does not mean you won't see ads; rather, it means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.<br><br></span></li>
<li>Anti-Cheat and Fraud Prevention Technologies<br><br><span style="font-weight: normal; color: #000000;">EA strives to provide a safe and fair gaming environment for all players. When you use our Services, we or third parties may use cookies and similar technologies and collect data about your machine or device, to create a machine "fingerprint" or "hash" of your machine components, for fraud prevention, security and authentication purposes. We may also monitor publicly-available information, third-party sites and/or use anti-cheat technology within our Services, including automated anti-fraud and abuse algorithms.

<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section4"></a>4. Information We Share With Third Parties</span></h2>
We do not share, sell (as the term is defined under applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act), or disclose your personal information, except as described in this policy. For a list of the categories of personal information we have sold or disclosed about consumers for a business purpose in the past 12 months, please contact us as set forth in Section 11 below.<br><br> <span style="color: #003366;"><b>Service providers.</b></span> We employ third parties located in and outside of your country of residence (including outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)) to collect or process personal information on our behalf for the purposes described in Section 3 above, including but not limited to conducting market surveys, providing IT and related services, facilitating credit card processing, facilitating live events, or sending emails. We require that any third party use the data only on our behalf and for purposes consistent with this policy.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Business partners.</b></span> We may provide personal information to business partners with whom we jointly offer Services. These partners include the companies that provide the platform on which you play or games, such as Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), or others.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Affiliates.</b></span> We may share personal information with our affiliated companies.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Advertising partners.</b></span> Through our Services, we may allow third-party advertising partners to set technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your use of EA's Services and your device (e.g., your IP address, mobile identifiers, page(s) visited, location, browser information, time of day). We may also combine and share such information and other information (such as your de-identified account information, demographic information, hardware specifications, and past purchase history) with third-party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third-party websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." We may allow access to other data collected by the Services to share information that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.<br><br>If you prefer not to share your EA personal information with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions on this page to change your settings: <a href="https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYCA/US/en/PC/">https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYCA/US/en/PC/</a>.<br><br>Please also refer to Section 2(D) above for more detail on your choices regarding online advertising.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Disclosures to protect us or others.</b></span> We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our or others' rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity. In particular, if we receive a report that you have violated our policies (like our Positive Play Charter at <a href="https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/charter">https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/charter</a>), we may disclose that report and other relevant information to the platform on which you play our games, such as Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), and others.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.</b></span> In the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we collect to the relevant third party and will obtain your consent to do so if required by law or contract.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Third-party plugins.</b></span> When third-party technologies or social tools are integrated into our Services, those third parties may collect information about your use of our Services. An example is the Facebook "Like" button.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>Cross-Platform Sharing.</b></span> Some of our games allow you to connect and play with friends and members of a game's community, regardless of what platform they play on. For example, someone on an Xbox could join a match with a player who is using a PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console. We call this ability to match players across platforms "Cross-Play." When Cross-Play is enabled and you play with someone on another platform, that other platform may receive your platform's ID (such as Xbox Gamertag, or Online ID of your account for PlayStation™Network) along with other information necessary to enable Cross-Play. In addition, we may provide information regarding your use of Cross-Play features to the platform on which you play our games. You can change your Cross-Play preferences by visiting the game's settings menu.<br><br>Some of our games may also allow you to connect your accounts across platforms. This could allow you to continue progress on a game between platforms, as well as enable the ability for your purchases on one platform to be available on another platform. We will also share the information with platforms to the extent necessary to enable these features.<br><br>Other platforms receiving your information may include Sony (PlayStation®4 system or PlayStation®5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), Nintendo (Nintendo Switch), Google (Stadia), Valve (Steam), Epic, and additional platforms as they become available for these features. Your information received by these platforms may be subject to their respective privacy notices.<br><br><span style="color: #003366;"><b>With Your Consent.</b></span> We may share information with other third parties with your express consent, unless otherwise described above. For example, you may agree to us sharing your information with a certain company or organization to hear about their products, services, or promotions, or if you tell us that you want to link your EA Account with another company’s services. Use of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' respective privacy notices.<br>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section5"></a>5. Where We Hold Your Information</span></h2>
Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third-party agents operate. By consenting to the transfer of your personal data outside of your country of residence, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.<br><br>EA's privacy practices comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. The APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies. More information about the APEC framework is available at <a href="https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx">https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx</a>.<br><br>Electronic Arts Inc. holds certifications under the (former) EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield which are available at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov">www.privacyshield.gov</a>. When Electronic Arts Inc. transfers information from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other affiliates, agents, or service providers that are outside the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland, it will do so in compliance with the 'Accountability for Onward Transfer' principle of the Privacy Shield. Where appropriate, EA, will rely on EU Standard Contractual clauses and other safeguards to enable transfers outside of the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland. In line with the July 16, 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in relation to the EU-US Privacy Shield and guidance from the European Data Protection Board, EA continues to assess the legal regime of the countries to which data is being transferred and, as necessary, updates measures to ensure that we provide adequate levels of protection.<br>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section6"></a>6. How We Protect Your Information</span></h2>
Security of your information is a priority at EA and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information. Even so, no security measure is 100% perfect. We cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use or access to your information under our control.<br>
<h2><span style="color: #003366;"><a name="section7"></a>7. Children</span></h2>
Although the majority of EA online and mobile games and Services are intended for adults, EA recognizes the importance of protecting children's privacy online. As applicable, we strive to follow the different minimum age guidelines set by the laws of individual countries or territories when determining the age that children can access certain features of our Services.<br><br><b><span style="color: #003366;">When players identify themselves as being children we will:</span></b><br>(1) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, according to applicable law. For example, we allow parents to create a child EA Account on certain Services, and with parental consent EA will collect and use certain children’s personal information to manage a child EA Account;<br><br>(2) disable features in certain Services that could allow a child to share information that directly identifies them. For example, we will disable features for children that would allow them to insert personal information (e.g. chat or text messages) in online or multiplayer games;<br><br>(3) collect and use certain information for limited purposes only. For example, we may send local in-app notifications, which do not rely on collecting personal information.&nbsp; Also, persistent identifiers (e.g. IP address or mobile advertising device identifier) may be collected to support our internal operations, such as:
<ul>
<li>Maintaining or analyzing the functionality of the Service;</li>
