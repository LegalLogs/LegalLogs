**2.    Consent to Use of Data.**  To facilitate product support, product development and improvement as well as other services to you, you agree that EA or other third parties may use cookies, web beacons and other analytic technologies to collect, use, store and transmit non-personally identifiable technical and related information regarding your mobile device (including unique device id or UDID), IP address, geo-location, device make and model, operating system, software and applications, including application usage data. In addition, EA and/or third parties may collect, store, use and transmit non-personally identifiable game play data, session data, browser identifiers, carrier information well as online and Application usage metrics, statistics and/or analytics.  **Data collected by third parties will be collected, used, stored, transferred and disclosed pursuant to the third party’s privacy policy.  See Appendix A for a non-exclusive list of third parties that may collect data via this Application.**  Appendix A includes both analytics companies and ad networks discussed in more detail in Section 3, below and includes URL’s for those third parties’ privacy policies and opt outs (if applicable). For data collected by or transferred to EA, EA may collect, use, store, share and transmit this information to third parties in a form that does not personally identify you in accordance with EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com).

Further, EA operates in several countries. Personal information collected from or submitted by you through an Application may be transferred to and stored on servers and equipment located in a destination outside your country of residence. The servers and equipment on which your data is stored and processed may be owned and operated by third parties with whom EA has contracted to receive, store and process your personal information. In addition, EA and those third parties that it has designated, may further transfer, store and process your personal information on servers and equipment located in other countries. You should be aware that the data protection laws of other countries may not be the same as the data protection laws of your country of residence. By submitting your personal information through an Application, you agree to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal information as described in this section.

**3.    Third Party Ad-Serving Technology.**

This Application may include third party dynamic behavioral in-game advertising technology which enables tailored advertising to be temporarily uploaded into the Application on your mobile device and replaced while you are online.  When you use this Application, we or third parties operating the advertisement serving technology may use demographic or other information collected directly from you and/or from third parties such as age and gender as well as information logged and/or collected from your device using cookies, web beacons and other technologies to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Application and to calculate the number of unique and repeat views of advertising. This technology also controls the number of times you see a given ad, delivers ads that relate to your interests and measures the effectiveness of ad campaigns.  Logged and/or collected data may include (but is not limited to) IP address, unique device I.D., browser identifiers, session information, browser cookies, device make and model, carrier provider, carrier user ID, geo-location information, sites visited, clicks on advertisements, advertisement(s) served, in game location, length of time an advertisement was visible, size of the advertisement, advertisement response (if any), game play information, general online and Application-specific usage data and metrics as well as angle of view. **The foregoing data may be collected, used, stored, transmitted and disclosed pursuant to the EA Privacy and Cookie Policy at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com), the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology and may be disclosed to other third parties in a form that does not personally identify you.**

**See Appendix A for a non-exclusive list of third parties that may collect data about your online behavior via this Application.**  Appendix A includes both analytics companies and ad networks (discussed above in Section 2) and includes URL’s for those third parties’ privacy policies and opt outs (if applicable).  You are responsible for reviewing the privacy policies of the third parties that may collect information via this Application.  If you do not wish to review those privacy policies or if you are concerned about the information they may collect, do not install or use this Application.  EA does not guarantee that all third parties that may collect information about you via this Application have an opt out for behavioral tracking.  In addition, EA does not guarantee or warrant that opting out of behavioral tracking from some or all of the entities listed in Appendix A will opt you out of advertising entirely.  Rather, if you opt out, you may continue to receive the same amount of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.

This ad serving technology is integrated into the game; if you do not want to use this technology, do not install or use this Application.

**4.    Consent to Public Display of Data.** If you participate in online services, such as online play or the downloading and uploading of content, EA may also collect, use, store, transmit and publicly display statistical data regarding game play (including scores, rankings and achievements), or identify content that is created and shared by you with other players.  Data that personally identifies you is collected, used, stored and transmitted in accordance with EA’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at [http://privacy.ea.com](http://privacy.ea.com).

**5.    Application Communications and Conduct/Privacy Settings; Origin Terms.**

a.    Origin Services

**SCRABBLE USERS:  SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR USE OF ORIGIN SERVICES BELOW.**

For Applications with Origin social services integrated therein, when you establish your Application profile, your privacy settings will govern how others can search for you within the service as well as who can see your profile, which will show which games and/or applications you have and play on your device (among other items that you choose to disclose).  When you log into the Application and if you choose to connect with friends on the Application, you agree that your friends will receive notifications about your game play activity, Application usage and stats.  If you do not want your friends to receive such notifications at any time, you can visit your privacy settings and/or block users at any time. When you log in initially, you also agree that your friends can search for you on Origin services (both mobile and PC) using your email address, among other identifiers that you may indicate.  You may be able to change that preference by visiting your privacy settings on your profile page.

Select Origin services will be available on both PC and mobile platforms.  You can log into all Origin services using your Origin Account (formerly EA Account).  Your Origin friends list, if you choose to have one, will be the same no matter where you log in.  For instance, if you utilize Origin features on your mobile application, your mobile Origin friends will appear in your Origin friends list on PC when you log in and vice versa. Likewise, your Origin PC friends’ list will also appear on your Origin mobile friends’ list when you log in there and vice versa.  **If you do not want friends to see your mobile and/or PC profile, including a list of your mobile and/or PC games and/or entitlements, please be sure to set your profile visibility settings to private or “no one can see.”**  You can block friends and/or revisit your privacy settings at any time.  Your profile visibility settings will remain constant across Origin platforms.**Your last communicated preference for profile visibility will govern visibility of your profile across all Origin service environments (i.e. mobile and PC).**  Your email searchability settings will also remain constant, meaning that if you allow your friends to find you via email address on Origin on mobile, members will be able to find you by searching for your email address in the PC Origin environment as well and vice versa.  **Your last communicated email searchability preference will apply to all Origin service environments (i.e. mobile and PC).**  Keep in mind that when you log into Origin on mobile, you agree to allow members search for you via your email address.  This preference will also apply to your Origin PC profile.  If you do not want to be searchable on Origin by email address, please visit your privacy settings via your profile page.  Note, however, that if you wish to turn off notifications to your friends about your game play events and stats, you must do so separately on mobile and PC Origin environments.  On PC, you must disable chat to turn off notifications.  In the mobile Origin environment, you must separately disable notifications via your privacy settings.  Likewise, if you wish not to have members find you using Facebook Connect, be sure to log out of Facebook in both the mobile PC Origin environments **and** adjust your privacy settings accordingly.  Check your privacy settings in all Origin environments often to ensure that they are set according to your preferences.

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR USERS OF ORIGIN SERVICES VIA SCRABBLE MOBILE:**  Origin Services on Scrabble do not currently have privacy settings other than email searchability.  Accordingly your Scrabble friends will see your Scrabble game activity and statistics via their newsfeeds in Origin mobile services in other games.  If you would like to opt out of this sharing feature, please contact us at [https://help.ea.com](https://help.ea.com).

Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about you or your children when using the Application.  EA does not endorse the content, messages and/or information exchanged by means of the Application and therefore you agree that EA is not liable with respect to the Application in general and/or any action resulting therefrom.

You are responsible for all actions that occur in connection with the Origin Account (formerly called “EA Account”) you use to register and log into this Application.  You agree to notify EA immediately of any unauthorized use of your Origin or EA Account or breach in security known to you related to the Application.

**6.    Termination.** This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate immediately and automatically without any notice from EA if you fail to comply with any of the terms and conditions of this License. Promptly upon termination, you must cease all use of the Application and destroy all copies of the Application in your possession or control.  Termination will not limit any of EA’s other rights or remedies at law or in equity. Sections 1(E), 2 through 16, and any Supplemental Terms of this License shall survive termination or expiration of this License for any reason.

**7.    Disclaimer of Warranties.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS,” WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WITHOUT PERFORMANCE ASSURANCES OR GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, AND YOUR USE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE ENTIRE RISK OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE RESIDES WITH YOU. EA AND EA’S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY “EA” FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION AND SECTION 8) DO NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION, UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND WARRANTIES (IF ANY) ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE.  EA DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLICATION; THAT THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT OPERATION OF THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; THAT THE APPLICATION WILL INTEROPERATE OR BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER APPLICATION; THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE APPLICATION WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR REINSTALLS TO THE SAME OR MULTIPLE DEVICES. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN ADVICE PROVIDED BY EA, OR ANY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATIONS ON THE APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**8.    Limitation of Liability.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL EA BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOST PROFITS, COST OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE APPLICATION, WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT EA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATIONS OR CERTAIN INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT ACTS, OR VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC STATUTES, OR THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  In no event shall EA’s total liability to you for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the amount actually paid by you for the Application.

**9.    Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties are Material Terms of this License.** You agree that the provisions in this License that limit liability are essential terms of this License.

**10.    Severability and Survival.** If any provision of this License is illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of the provision shall be amended to achieve as closely as possible the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this License shall continue in full force and effect.

**11.    U.S. Government Restricted Rights.** If you are a government end user, then this provision applies to you.  The Application provided in connection with this License has been developed entirely at private expense, as defined in FAR section 2.101, DFARS section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and DFARS section 252.227-7015 (or any equivalent or subsequent agency regulation thereof), and is provided as “commercial items,” “commercial computer Application” and/or “commercial computer Application documentation.”  Consistent with DFARS section 227.7202 and FAR section 12.212, and to the extent required under U.S. federal law, the minimum restricted rights as set forth in FAR section 52.227-19 (or any equivalent or subsequent agency regulation thereof), any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure or distribution thereof by or for the U.S. Government shall be governed solely by this License and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by this License.

**12.    Injunctive Relief.** You agree that a breach of this License will cause irreparable injury to EA for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and EA shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security or proof of damages.

**13.    Governing Law.** If you reside in a Member State of the European Union: (i) the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this License and your use of the Application; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this License and/or your use of the Application shall be the Courts of England, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts.  If you reside elsewhere: (i) the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this License and/or your use of the Application; and (ii) you expressly agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this License and/or your use of the Application shall be the federal or state courts that cover San Mateo County, California, and you expressly consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts to the extent applicable pursuant to Section 15, below.  Please note that your conduct may also be subject to other local, state, national, and international laws.  The parties agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (Vienna, 1980) shall not apply to this License or to any dispute or transaction arising out of this License.

**14.    Export.** You agree to abide by U.S. and other applicable export control laws and agree not to transfer the Application to a foreign national, or national destination, which is prohibited by such laws, without first obtaining, and then complying with, any requisite government authorization. You certify that you are not a person with whom EA is prohibited from transacting business under applicable law.

**15.    Resolution By Binding Arbitration.**

**PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

1.  Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at [https://help.ea.com](https://help.ea.com).  **In the unlikely event that EA cannot resolve a concern to your satisfaction (or if EA cannot resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally), then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us.  This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law, but expressly excludes residents of Quebec, Switzerland, Russia and the Member States of the European Union.  This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly.  It covers any and all disputes between us (“_Disputes_”), including without limitation:**  
      
    
    1.  claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;
    
      
    
    1.  claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);
    
      
    
    1.  claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and
    
      
    
    1.  claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.
    
    The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following:
    
    1.  a claim to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or EA’s (or any of EA’s licensors’) intellectual property rights;
    
      
    
    1.  a claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, or unauthorized use;
    
      
    
    1.  In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action.
    
    **By entering into this Agreement, you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.**  With respect to this Section, References to "EA," "you," and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior agreements between us.  This EULA evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.  This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this EULA.
    
2.  **Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute.**  You and EA agree to first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally before initiating arbitration.  Such negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other (“Notice of Dispute”).  Notices of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand").  EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address (if you provided it to us) or to the email address you provided to us.  You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.

  

1.  **Binding Arbitration.**  If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute, either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.  Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.  **YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.**  The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“_AAA_”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“_AAA Consumer Rules_”), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org).  Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.  If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration, then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses.  The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.  The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.  The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.  You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

  

1.  **Restrictions.**  You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually.  To the full extent permitted by law:  (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.  **YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, unless both you and EA agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute resolution/arbitration provision shall be null and void.

  

1.  **Location.**  If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you.  For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

  

1.  **Recovery and Attorneys’ Fees.**  If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before final written submissions are made to the arbitrator, then EA will:  
      
    
    1.  Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 over and above your arbitration award; and
    
      
    
    1.  Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration ("_the attorney premium_").
    
    The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
    
    The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law, although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.  EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us.
    
2.  **Limitation on Arbitrator’s Authority.**  The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

  

1.  **Changes to Agreement.**  Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice of Dispute address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to the Notice of Dispute address provided above.  By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.

**16.    Entire Agreement.**  This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and EA with respect to the Application and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless made in writing and signed by EA.  No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of any other right hereunder.  In the event of a conflict between this License and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this License shall govern.
