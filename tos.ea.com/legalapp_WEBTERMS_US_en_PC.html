To create one, you must be at least the <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/account/online-access-for-child-accounts/" style="color: #ffffff;">minimum age</a> and your parents must read and agree to these terms if you are a minor. EA can suspend or terminate your account if you break this agreement. You may cancel your EA Account or any EA subscriptions at any time.</span></p>
<p>You need an EA Account to access and use many EA Services, including to play online.</p>
<p>To create an EA Account, you must have a valid email address, and provide truthful and accurate information. You must be eligible to use the EA Service for which you are registering and must be a resident of a country where use of EA Services is permitted.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years of age (or the minimum age of your country of residence) to create an EA Account. If your age is between the relevant minimum age and 18 (or the age of majority where you live), you and your parent or guardian must review and agree to this Agreement together. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using EA Services. EA recommends that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child.</p>
<p>You are responsible for the activity on your EA Account; it's yours, don't share it. Your EA Account may be suspended or terminated if someone else uses it to engage in activity that violates this Agreement.</p>
<p>You may cancel your EA Account or a subscription to an EA Service at any time by contacting EA's Customer Service Department at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/" style="color: #3300cc;">help.ea.com</a>. To complete your request, EA may collect fees or costs incurred, if allowed by law, and any amounts owed to third-party vendors or content providers.</p>
<h2><a name="section2"></a>2. License</h2>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">EA grants you access to our games and services to you for your personal enjoyment.</span></p>
<p>The EA Services are licensed to you, not sold. EA grants you a personal, limited, non-transferable (i.e., not for sharing), revocable and non-exclusive license to use the EA Services to which you have access for your non-commercial use, subject to your compliance with this Agreement. You may not access, copy, modify or distribute any EA Service, Content or Entitlements (as those terms are defined below), unless expressly authorized by EA or permitted by law. You may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract or otherwise use source code or other data from EA Services, unless expressly authorized by EA or permitted by law. EA or its licensors own and reserve all other rights, including all right, title and interest in the EA Services and associated intellectual property rights.</p>
<h2><a name="section3"></a>3. Content and Entitlements</h2>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">EA provides games, features and content through a series of entitlements. Some entitlements are unlocked using virtual currency that has no value outside of our games.</span></p>
<p>The EA Services include Content and Entitlements. Content is the software, technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, video, code, and all audio visual or other material appearing on or coming from EA Services, as well as the design and appearance of our websites. Content also includes user-generated Content ("UGC"). UGC includes EA Account personas, forum posts, profile content and other Content contributed by users to EA Services. All Content is either owned by EA or its licensors, or is licensed to EA and its licensors pursuant to Section 5 below.</p>
<p>Entitlements are rights that EA licenses to you to access or use the online or off-line elements of EA Services. Examples of Entitlements include access to digital or unlockable Content; additional or enhanced functionality (including multiplayer services); subscriptions; virtual assets; unlock keys or codes, serial codes or online authentication; in-game accomplishments; and virtual points, coins, or currencies.</p>
<p>We refer to these virtual points, coins or currencies as "EA Virtual Currency". When you obtain EA Virtual Currency from us or our authorized partners, you receive a personal, limited, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and select the Entitlements that EA expressly makes available to you.</p>
<p>EA Virtual Currency has no monetary value and has no value outside of our products and services. EA Virtual Currency cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash; it only may be redeemed for Entitlements available for the EA Service. EA Virtual Currency is non-refundable, and you are not entitled to a refund for any unused EA Virtual Currency. Once you redeem EA Virtual Currency for an Entitlement, that Entitlement is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable. If you live in Japan, you agree to use any EA Virtual Currency within 180 days from the date of purchase.</p>
<p>You will provide at your own expense the equipment, Internet connection and charges required to access and use EA Services.</p>
<h2><a name="section4"></a>4. Availability of EA Services and Updates</h2>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">Our games and services may not always be available or operate on all devices. We also may make updates or changes to our games and services, which might impact your use or game progress.</span></p>
<p>We do not guarantee that any EA Service, Content or Entitlement will be available at all times, in all locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer a particular EA Service, Content or Entitlements for any particular length of time. EA does not guarantee that EA Services can be accessed on all devices, by means of a specific Internet or connection provider, or in all geographic locations.</p>
<p>From time to time, EA may update, change or modify an EA Service, Content or Entitlements, without notice to you. These updates and modifications may be required in order to continue to use EA Services.</p>
<p>EA may need to update, or reset certain parameters to balance game play and usage of EA Services. These updates or "resets" may cause you setbacks within the relevant game world and may affect characters, games, groups or other Entitlements under your control.</p>
<p>EA may also take actions on your EA Account and Entitlements without notice to you to protect you or EA, such as preventing unauthorized access, resetting EA Account passwords, suspending EA Account access, deleting data or removing EA Accounts from EA Services. Your availability to EA Services may also be affected in response to actual or suspected Rules of Conduct violations, as further described in Section 6.</p>
<h2><a name="section5"></a>5. Your UGC</h2>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">You allow EA and our players to use anything you upload or create (UGC) for free within our games and services.

EA does not assume any responsibility or liability for UGC, for removing it, or not removing it or other Content. EA does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC available on EA Services.</p>
<p>When you contribute UGC, you grant to EA, its licensors and licensees a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, worldwide, sublicensable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly display or otherwise transmit and communicate the UGC, or any portion of it, in any manner or form and in any medium or forum, whether now known or later devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you or any third party. You also grant to all other users who can access and use your UGC on an EA Service the right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant EA Service without further notice, attribution or compensation to you.</p>

<p>If you or someone using your EA Account violates these rules and fails to remedy this violation after a warning, EA may take action against you, including revoking access to certain or all EA Services, Content or Entitlements, or terminating your EA Account as described in Section 8. In case of severe violations, EA may take these actions without issuing a prior warning. Some examples of severe violations include, but are not limited to: promoting, encouraging or engaging in hacking, selling EA accounts or entitlements (including virtual currencies and items) without EA’s permission, extreme harassment, or threatening illegal activities. When practical, EA will notify you of the action it will take in response to violations of these rules or breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Specific EA Services may post additional rules that apply to your conduct on those services.</p>

<p>This Section applies to EA's games and game subscriptions ("EA Games"), including EA Games that run on a Personal Computer ("EA PC Games"), and the EA-owned client application and related services that distributes EA PC Games (the "EA app" currently <a href="https://www.origin.com/en-us/about" style="color: #3300cc;">https://www.origin.com/en-us/about</a>).</p>
<h3>A. Technical and Content Protection Measures</h3>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">We use specific security software to combat piracy and cheating, and tampering with it can result in losing access to our games.</span></p>
<p>EA utilizes technical or content protection measures, developed by EA or third-party partners, for EA Services in order to prevent piracy and the unauthorized copying or use of EA Games. Attempting to circumvent, disable or tamper with these measures shall terminate this license.</p>
<h3>B. EA app</h3>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">To play our PC games, you may need to install our PC distribution platform software. We may automatically update the software. We provide instructions so you can uninstall our games and software.</span></p>
<p>To play EA PC Games, EA may require you to install and use the EA app client application or successor application. An EA Account, your acceptance of this Agreement, and an Internet connection are required for the EA app to authenticate and verify your license to the EA PC Game ("Authenticate" or "Authentication").</p>
<p>To access and use EA Services associated with an EA PC Game, you may first need to register with the serial code enclosed with an EA PC Game. The serial code provided with the EA PC Game will be verified during Authentication. Authentication is limited to one EA Account per serial code, which means the EA PC Game is not transferable. You may only launch and access an EA PC Game on no more than five unique machines in any rolling 24-hour period.</p>
<p>The EA app and EA PC Games may download and install updates, upgrades and additional features. You agree that EA has no obligation to support previous version(s) of the EA app upon the availability of an update, upgrade and/or implementation of additional features. EA may provide you with the option to download, install and use an alpha or beta version of the EA app under these same terms.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/origin/origin/manually-uninstalling-origin/" style="color: #3300cc;">Instructions</a> to uninstall the EA app client can be found on EA’s help website, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/" style="color: #3300cc;">help.ea.com</a>.</p>
<p>You may uninstall EA PC Games at any time using the EA app interface and deleting any remaining locally saved files. Punkbuster may remain on your computer after uninstall.

<h3>C. Monitoring and Anti-Cheat Measures</h3>
<p style="background-color: #3300cc; padding: 10px; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: normal;">ⓘ</span> <span style="margin-left: 20px;">EA installs software to detect cheating or hacking. These programs send data on your computer to EA.</span></p>
<p>EA utilizes technologies to detect and prevent cheating in the use of EA Services, and in particular, EA Games. These technologies may be developed by EA or a third party.</p>
<p>When you launch an online-capable game, these technologies may activate using kernel, admin or user privileges, and monitor your gameplay and device’s RAM, processes, communications, and file storage for the purposes of detecting violations of, and enforcing, the Code of Conduct in Section 6, including the use of Unauthorized Third-Party Programs. An Unauthorized Third-Party Program is a third-party program or file (such as a "add-on", "mod", "hack", "trainer", or "cheat") that EA believes (i) enables or facilitates cheating of any type; (ii) allows users to modify or hack the game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by EA; or (iii) intercepts, "mines", or otherwise collects information from or through the game.</p>
<p>EA may collect relevant information needed for our investigation and enforcement purposes such as your account information, details related to an Unauthorized Third-Party Program, any EA PC Game files that were modified, and times cheating was detected. We also may terminate your License and your EA Account if we determine you have been cheating.</p>
<p>When you exit an online-capable game, these anti-cheat technologies will be deactivated.</p>

<p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or EA. EA may terminate your access and use of any EA Services or your EA Account if EA determines that you have violated this Agreement or that there has been otherwise unlawful, improper or fraudulent use of EA Services on your EA Account.

If your EA Account is terminated, you will not have access to your EA Account or Entitlements and may be barred from accessing or using any EA Service again. Upon termination, your license under this Agreement also shall terminate.</p>
<p>Instead of termination and prior to any termination, EA may issue you a warning, suspend or alter your access to a particular EA Service or your EA Account, remove or revoke Entitlements at an EA Account or device level, remove or delete any Content which is in violation with this Agreement, or ban your device or machine from accessing specific EA Services.

<p>This Section 15 offers a streamlined way to resolve disputes between us if they arise. Most of your concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily by logging into the EA customer support interface with your Account at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/" style="color: #3300cc;">help.ea.com</a>. If EA cannot resolve your concern, you and EA agree to be bound by the procedure set forth in this Section to resolve any and all disputes between us.</p>
<p>This Section 15 is an agreement between you and EA, and applies to our respective agents, employees, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, beneficiaries and assigns. This agreement to arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 15 and any arbitration carried out under this Section. This Section 15 shall be interpreted broadly and shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
<h3>A. Claims Covered by Arbitration</h3>
<p>All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any EA Service and its marketing, or the relationship between you and EA, including the validity, enforceability, and scope of this Section 15 ("Disputes"), shall be determined exclusively by binding arbitration. This includes claims that accrued before you entered into this Agreement. The only Disputes not covered by this Section 15 are claims (i) regarding the infringement, protection or validity of your, EA's or EA's licensors' trade secrets, copyright, trademark or patent rights; (ii) if you reside in Australia, to enforce a statutory consumer right under Australian consumer law; and (iii) brought in small claims court.</p>
<h3>B. Informal Negotiations</h3>
<p>You and EA shall first attempt to resolve any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. The informal negotiations begin upon receipt of written notice from one party to the other ("Notice of Dispute"). The Notice of Dispute must: (a) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing or email address. You will send your Notice of Dispute to: Electronic Arts Inc., 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065, ATTENTION: Legal Department.</p>
<h3>C. Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>If you and EA cannot resolve a Dispute informally, you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules ("AAA Consumer Rules"), which are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/" style="color: #3300cc;">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879, with the following modifications:</p>
<p>1. Arbitration fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the administrative fees required to initiate an arbitration, EA will pay all AAA administrative fees.</p>
<p>2. If the Dispute does not exceed $25,000, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of written submissions.</p>
<p>3. The parties may bring any dispositive motion or motions during the course of the proceedings.</p>
<p>4. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, which will include the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator has the authority to issue any relief allowed by applicable law, but the arbitrator shall have no authority to issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>
<p>The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<h3>D. Limitations</h3>
<p><b>YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AS TO ALL DISPUTES.</b> The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. If this paragraph D is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.</p>
<h3>E. Location</h3>
<p>If you live in the United States, arbitration will take place in the county in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo, State of California, United States of America, and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay the proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<h3>F. Recovery</h3>
<p>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA's last written settlement offer made before EA makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then EA will:</p>
<p>1. Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and</p>
<p>2. Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.</p>
<h3>G. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>EA will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.</p>
<h3>H. Severability</h3>
<p>If any clause within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause in paragraph D above) is found to be unenforceable because it would preclude a particular claim or remedy (such as public injunctive relief), that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be severed from arbitration and may be brought in court, while any remaining claims or remedies will be resolved through arbitration. If any clause within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause set forth in paragraph D above) is found to be unenforceable for any other reason, that clause will be severed from this Section 15 and the remainder of this Section 15 will remain in full force and effect.</p>
