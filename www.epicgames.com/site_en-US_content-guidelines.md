**EPIC GAMES - Content Guidelines**
===================================

Epic’s games and services let you create and share content with a wide and diverse audience. We want the Epic ecosystem to be welcoming for everyone, so certain content can’t be shared or transmitted through our services.

### **Intolerant or Discriminatory Content**

The Epic ecosystem welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, or other groups. We don’t tolerate discriminatory behavior towards anyone in our community.

### **Graphic/Explicit Content**

The Epic ecosystem requires content remain appropriate for the game’s product rating. Avoid overly violent and/or sexual content to the extent such content isn't reflected in the rating.

### **Illegal Activities**

Don’t contribute to content involving or promoting illegal activities, including harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, or piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place here.

### **Scams and Deceptive Practices**

Do not take advantage of fellow players. Creating content to scam/deceive players out of their account information or money will result in removal from content programs or more severe penalties. Use #ReportACreator if you believe a Creator is up to no good. 

### **Infringing or Unauthorized Content**

Don’t share or use content you didn’t create or have permission from the owner to use. Credit the creator if you’re sharing/reposting the content of others.
