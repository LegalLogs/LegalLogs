Epic Games - Community Rules
============================

We want Epic Games to be a safe and fun place for you to play games or hang with your friends. We need your help to keep it that way.

The Epic Terms of Service and game agreements contain rules that apply to your use of Epic’s services, so some of these rules may look familiar. But Epic offers so many ways to interact with others through its games, services, and environments that more explanation of our community standards is helpful. 

Our Community Rules apply to all users of Epic’s games, services, and environments. These standards are a guide on how you should interact when inside the Epic Games ecosystem. We included some specific examples below, but just because something isn’t specifically called out below doesn’t mean it’s OK. 

Following the rules, not super hard. However, if you violate these rules, it can result in action against your account all the way up to a permanent ban. 

Community Rules
---------------

### Personal Information

_Keep it secret, keep it safe._

You’re never allowed to share other people’s personal information other than display names and we strongly encourage you not to share yours. Sharing someone’s alternate account names, real-world location, real name, etc. is not allowed.

### Bullying and Harassment\*

_We’re all here to have fun, let’s keep it friendly._

Respect other people - when chatting, playing or creating. Communicating or behaving in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, or abusive is against the rules.

Trying to make someone else feel worse so you feel better doesn’t work - It is much easier, and more fun, to enjoy the experience together!

### Impersonation

_You’re great. Be you._

Don’t impersonate other users, streamers, celebrities, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. And don’t take credit for another user’s creation. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.

### Cheating and Trolling

_A fair game is a fun game._

Play fairly and within the rules of the game. Don’t cheat, grief, team, or exploit bugs and game outcome impacting glitches. Find an exploit? [Report it.](https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/?contact=1)

### Intolerance and Discrimination

Epic does not tolerate any form of hate or discrimination.  
  
The Epic ecosystem welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, and national origin. Don’t demean, marginalize, use hateful language against, or belittle other users or groups. **Respect fellow players.**

### Dangerous or Illegal Activities

Respect local laws and don’t participate in or encourage illegal or dangerous activities, including gambling, drug use, phishing, etc. Threats of harm to yourself or others are taken seriously—don’t make them, especially as a joke.

### Inappropriate Content

Content, communications, and activity in the Epic ecosystem shouldn’t keep others from having positive experiences. All content must follow the [Content Guidelines](/site/content-guidelines).

Consequences
------------

The type of action we’ll take for a particular violation of these rules is determined on a case-by-case basis. We’ll look at severity, whether you’re a repeat offender, and other factors. Action taken can be anything from a warning for less severe offenses, all the way up to a permanent account ban.

If your account is permanently banned, the account owner may lose all rights to games, virtual items,  account balances, or other items that you may have earned or purchased. If you have multiple accounts, we may take action against all of your accounts.

Player Reporting
----------------

We are all a part of this community, and it is up to us to keep it friendly, fun and free of negativity.  
  
If you encounter a player not respecting the Community Rules, Content Guidelines, and other players, you can report them via [in-game reporting](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-report-bad-player-behavior-in-fortnite-a3276) or by contacting our [player support team](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/contact-us). We will take action against players we observe not following the Community Rules and escalate based upon the offense.  
  
If you meet someone you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Rules, you can [block the person](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-manage-my-party-and-voice-chat-options-from-the-fortnite-lobby-a3477) with one tap.

Safety and Security
-------------------

Keep account information safe and private. Giving access to your account puts you at risk. Do not share your account information or the account information of others.

When it comes to safety within the Epic ecosystem and staying secure we believe in providing you all the tools necessary. You can find a full set of all the account security things you can do and stuff we currently do in our [FAQ](https://www.epicgames.com/store/news/epic-games-account-security).

If you are curious about [Parental Controls](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/parental-controls) and how you can moderate your child’s playtime or interactions within Epic Games, head over to our Parental Control hub within account management. Here’s a look at how you can adjust social settings in Fortnite for example:

The Epic Community Rules are not final and will change over time, so make sure you check back regularly to stay up to date. “But, I didn’t know…” is not a valid excuse, and honestly a pretty bad one. We’re all here to have fun, create and enjoy great games!

Thank you for being a part of the Epic community and doing your part to maintain a safe and fun space for everyone.
