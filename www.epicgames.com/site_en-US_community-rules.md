**EPIC GAMES - COMMUNITY RULES**
================================

We want Epic Games to be a safe and fun place for you to play games or hang with your friends. We need your help to keep it that way.  
  
The Epic Terms of Service and other agreements contain rules that apply to your use of Epic’s services, so some of these rules may look familiar. But Epic offers so many ways to interact with others through its games, services, and environments that more explanation of our community standards is helpful.   
  
Our Community Rules apply to all users of Epic’s games, services, and environments. These standards are a guide on how you should interact when inside the Epic Games ecosystem. We included some specific examples below, but just because something isn’t specifically called out below doesn’t mean it’s OK.   
  
Following the rules is not super hard. If you violate these rules, however, it can result in action against your account all the way up to a permanent ban.

**Community Rules**
----------------------

###   
Personal Information

You’re never allowed to share other people’s personal information other than display names, and we strongly encourage you not to share yours. Sharing or threatening to share someone’s alternate account names, real-world location, real name, etc. is not allowed.  
 

### Intolerance and Discrimination

Epic does not tolerate any form of hate or discrimination.  
  
The Epic ecosystem welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Don’t demean, marginalize, use hateful language against, or belittle other users or groups.   
 

### Bullying and Harassment

Respect other people - when chatting, playing or creating. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, or abusive is against the rules.  
  
Trying to make someone else feel worse so you feel better doesn’t work - It is much easier, and more fun, to enjoy the experience together!  
 

### Impersonation

Don’t impersonate other players, streamers, celebrities, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. And don’t take credit for another player or entity’s creation. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.  
 

### Cheating and Trolling

Play fairly and within the rules of the game. Don’t cheat, grief, team, or exploit bugs and glitches. Don’t promote or advertise known cheats, bugs, or exploits. Find an exploit? [Report it.](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/epic-games-store-c73)  
 

### Dangerous or Illegal Activities

Don’t participate in or encourage illegal or dangerous activities within the community, including gambling, illegal drug use, phishing, human trafficking, prostitution, doxing, swatting, or sharing content that glorifies or incites violence. Threats of harm to yourself or others are taken seriously—don’t make them, especially as a joke. If you see something that puts other players at risk, use in-game reporting ([Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-report-bad-player-behavior-in-fortnite-a3276), [Rocket League](https://support.rocketleague.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015606894-How-Do-I-Report-a-Player-#:~:text=If%20you%20would%20like%20to,language%2C%20flooding%2C%20etc.))) or [let our player support team know](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/).  
 

### Scams and Deceptive Practices

Do not take advantage of fellow players. Scams or deceptive practices are prohibited, including seeking account information, and buying or selling accounts or personal information.  
 

### Inappropriate Content

Content, communications, and activity in the Epic ecosystem shouldn’t keep others from having positive experiences. All content must follow the [Content Guidelines](https://www.epicgames.com/site/content-guidelines).

**Consequences**
-------------------

The type of action we’ll take for a particular violation of these rules is determined on a case-by-case basis. We’ll look at severity, whether you’re a repeat offender, and other factors. Action taken can be anything from a warning for less severe offenses, a loss of access to social features such as voice chat and adding friends, or all the way up to a permanent account ban.  
  
If your account is permanently banned, you may lose all rights to games, virtual items, account balances, or other items that you may have earned or purchased. If you have multiple accounts, we may take action against all of your accounts.

**Player Reporting**
-----------------------

We are all a part of this community, and it is up to us to keep it friendly, fun, and free of negativity.  
  
If you encounter a player not respecting the Community Rules, [Content Guidelines](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/content-guidelines), and other players, you can report them via [in-game reporting](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-report-bad-player-behavior-in-fortnite-a3276).  
  
If you meet someone you don’t like but aren’t violating the Community Rules, you can [block the person](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/battle-royale-c93/how-do-i-manage-my-party-and-voice-chat-options-from-the-fortnite-lobby-a3477).

**Safety and Security**
--------------------------

Keep account information safe and private. Giving access to your account puts you at risk. If something seems suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is. There’s no such thing as free V-Bucks. Do not share your account information or the account information of others.  
  
When it comes to safety within the Epic ecosystem and staying secure we believe in providing you all the tools necessary. You can find a full set of all the things you can do to better protect yourself and what we currently do to keep you safe in our [FAQ](https://www.epicgames.com/store/news/epic-games-account-security).  
  
If you are curious about [Parental Controls](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/parental-controls) and how you can moderate your child’s playtime or interactions within Epic Games, head over to our Parental Control hub within account management.

The Epic Community Rules are not final and may change over time, so make sure you check back regularly to stay up to date. “But, I didn’t know…” is not a good excuse. We’re all here to have fun, create and enjoy great games!
