<h1><span>Securing your Epic Account</span></h1>

<h2><span>Use Unique Passwords</span></h2>

<p><span>We recommend using </span><em><span>unique</span></em><span> passwords as a way to protect your account. Having a unique password for every service will guarantee that one compromised password won’t allow access to your Epic account.</span></p>

<h2><span>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</span></h2>

<p><span>Two-Factor authentication allows you to require a code from a device you own before you can login, this makes it much more difficult for someone to gain unauthorized access. We currently support email, SMS and app based 2FA. </span><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/epic-accounts-c74/account-security-c112/twofactor-authentication-and-how-to-enable-it-a3218"><u><span>Get protected now</span></u></a><span>.</span></p>
&nbsp;

<p><span>Be sure to also protect your accounts for other services too. The services you can link your Epic account with also support 2FA. You can find more information about enabling 2FA on those services here.</span></p>

<h2><span>Verify Your Email Address</span></h2>
&nbsp;

<p><span>While it is currently optional, we strongly recommend you <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/epic-accounts-c74/general-support-c79/how-do-i-verify-my-email-address-a3619">verify the email address</a>&nbsp;</span><span>associated with your Epic account. This helps protect your account with our two-factor authentication and makes it easier for Player Support to assist you in the event of any suspicious activity with your account.</span></p>

<h2><span>Link Your Social Accounts For Extra Security</span></h2>

<p><span>We offer <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/epic-accounts-c74/general-support-c79/how-do-i-sign-in-with-facebook-or-google-a3621">support to integrate Facebook and Google</a>&nbsp;</span><span>logins with our Epic account system. This allows you to log into your Epic account without requiring a separate password as long as you’re actively logged into Google or Facebook. </span><strong><span>Please be sure to protect your social accounts with a unique password and 2FA.</span></strong></p>
&nbsp;

<h2><span>Keep Your Computer Secured</span></h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Use antivirus software and keep it up to date. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Don’t trust shared systems. You could be at a cyber cafe, library, school, or even a friends house. If it isn’t your computer then do not trust it with your account info. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Keep your computer up to date. Be sure to keep your operating system, software, and drivers updated. </span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><span>Don’t Buy or Share Accounts</span></h2>

<p><span>Account buying, selling, or sharing is not allowed. Any actions committed on your account are your responsibility. Any bans received on your account as a result of sharing are your responsibility as the account owner. </span></p>
&nbsp;

<p><span>Buying and selling accounts is against our terms of service and will result in an account ban. </span></p>

<h2><span>Don’t Trust Suspicious Offers</span></h2>

<p><span>There are plenty of sites you have come across that offer “free” games or items (such as V-Bucks) for your account. These offers are not real. If a game is truly free then it will be offered for free in the official Epic Games Store. </span></p>
