<h1><strong>Epic Games Store Refund Policy</strong></h1>
Don’t like what you bought? Read on for how to return your purchase for a refund.&nbsp; If you’ve recently made a purchase through the Epic Games Store and want a refund, you’re in the right place. Below you’ll find all the info on what you can refund, when you can refund, and how to begin the process.

<h2><strong>What types of products can I return for a refund?</strong></h2>

<p>Games and products you purchase through the Epic Games Store are generally eligible for a refund.&nbsp; If a game or product is marked as "non-refundable", then it will not be eligible. Products that include virtual currency, skins, or other consumables are not eligible for refund. Epic cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of the Epic Games Store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you receive a refund for a game, you will also receive a refund for all in-app and downloadable content purchases you made through the Epic Games Store for that game, so long as that content has not been consumed, modified, or transferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some purchases may qualify for refunding online by yourself.&nbsp; Sign into your account on our website, click the Account dropdown on the top right of the store, go to the Transactions tab and click the game title. If the game is eligible for a self-service refund, please click the “Refund” button to start the refund process.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>When are products eligible for a refund?</strong></h2>

<p>Games and products are eligible for refund within 14 days of purchase. However, you must have less than 2 hours of runtime on record. Products that include virtual currency, skins, or other consumables and products or games that are marked as “non-refundable” are not eligible for refund.</p>

<p>You will not be eligible for refunds for games or products from which you have been banned or for which you have otherwise violated the terms of service. In addition, you may not be eligible for refunds if Epic determines that you are abusing the refund policy.<br>

&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What about pre-purchases?</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>What if a product I recently purchased goes on sale?</strong></h2>

<p>You can refund your purchase for a full refund and immediately re-purchase the product as long as it abides by the above guidelines, we do not consider this to be refund abuse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Epic determines you are abusing the refund policy, you may not be eligible for refunds. The policy exists so you can purchase with comfort and make sure you only spend on the games you want to pay for and play!</p>
