<p align="justify"><b>Collection and Use of Personal Data: </b>In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of Data: identifiers, personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute, commercial information, internet or other similar network activity, and geolocation data. For examples of more specific information we collect and the sources of such collection, please see Section 3 ‘When does Ubisoft collect your Personal Data and for what purpose?’ in the Privacy Policy.
