**Ubisoft+ Subscription Terms**
===============================

Last Updated: May 24, 2021

   
Ubisoft+ is a subscription program provided to you by Ubisoft and, if applicable, purchased from an authorized third party (“Third Party Seller”).  These terms (“Ubisoft+ Terms”) describe your rights and obligations with respect to a Ubisoft+ subscription (“Subscription” or “Ubisoft+”) and any of the Ubisoft content (including, without limitation, Ubisoft games and downloadable content) accessible to you as part of the Subscription (collectively, the “Ubisoft+ Services"). These Ubisoft+ Terms are incorporated by reference into the Ubisoft Terms of Use available at [https://legal.ubi.com/termsofuse](https://legal.ubi.com/termsofuse) (“Terms of Use”) and together make up the entire agreement between Ubisoft and you relating to the Subscription, and replace any prior understandings or agreements (whether oral or written) regarding such.  All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Use.

**1\.           Eligibility**
-----------------------------

You must have a valid and active Ubisoft Account to access Ubisoft+. Please note that Ubisoft+, including other features such as Multi-Platform Access (defined below), are not available in all countries and age restrictions apply and vary by country.

**2**.           **Ubisoft+ Services**
--------------------------------------

Ubisoft Account holders with an active Subscription may be offered the following Subscription benefits: 

a) access to a limited library of Ubisoft PC games available here: [https://store.ubi.com/ubisoftplus/games](https://store.ubi.com/ubisoftplus/games), which may include additional content such as DLCs and expansion packs, for unlimited online play for the duration of the games’ availability on Ubisoft+ (the “Ubisoft+ Games”);. Please note that physical add-ons, in-game credits, boosts and other digital consumables are excluded from these editions, unless otherwise specifically indicated to the contrary. Ubisoft is entitled to remove at any time at its sole discretion any premium content from the editions of the Ubisoft+ Games;

b) as available, the ability to access certain Ubisoft+ Services on third-party gaming platforms (“Multi-Platform Access”);

c) inclusion in early access programs, when applicable, giving subscribers the ability to get an early access to certain Ubisoft games prior to the date such games are otherwise generally available to the public (“Early Access”);

d) inclusion in beta programs, when applicable; 

e) when applicable, discounts on certain Ubisoft games, merchandise and other content (to be updated from time to time) offered through the Ubisoft Store (“Discounts”); and

f)  enabling Users with an active Subscription to get access to a dedicated roster of rewards (the “Rewards”). Such Rewards may include in-game content drops and/or any other benefit Ubisoft may include as a Reward.

Please note that (i) Rewards may be subject to verification, (ii) Rewards are not transferable, (iii) the availability of Rewards may change; and (iv) unless otherwise specified by Ubisoft, Users who have cancelled their Subscription will be considered to be new Users for the purpose of Rewards if they re-subscribe to Ubisoft+ at a later time (in other words, any status based on subscriber time will be re-set upon cancellation). Additional terms and conditions may apply to how Rewards are granted and/or any Reward.  Ubisoft reserves the right to remove any Reward and/or the ability to receive Rewards in the event of any fraud or abuse as determined in our sole discretion, and reserves the right to change or terminate the way Rewards are provided at any time and in any manner without notice.

The Ubisoft+ Services are subject to change at anytime and limitations and exclusions apply.  For current details on the specific Ubisoft+ Services available as part of your Subscription, please regularly visit [https://support.ubi.com/Faqs/000043786/](https://support.ubi.com/Faqs/000043786/).  **Please note that the Ubisoft+ Services may vary depending on your age and country.**

**3**.           **AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS PURCHASED FROM UBISOFT**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE NOTE THAT, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CHOOSE TO SUBSCRIBE TO UBISOFT+, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL **AUTOMATICALLY RENEW EACH MONTH** AT THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PRICE (PLUS APPLICABLE TAX OR INCLUSIVE OF APPLICABLE TAXES BASED ON BILLING ADDRESS) ON EACH RENEWAL DATE WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL ACTION BY YOU-- **UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION**. 

**4**.           **Price,** **Billing and Payment Methods For Subscription Purchased From Ubisoft**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Subscription fee for Ubisoft+ Services will be charged on the specific billing date indicated on your Ubisoft Account page.  You must provide a valid payment method to register for a Subscription, and Ubisoft may ask you to update your payment method at any time if it becomes invalid. Recurring renewal payments will be taken from the payment method you selected at sign-up, unless and until you change your payment method and/or it becomes invalid.  You authorize Ubisoft to charge any payment method associated with your Account in case your primary payment method is expired or otherwise declined. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration of the payment method, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Ubisoft may suspend your access to Ubisoft+ until having successfully charged a valid payment method. Ubisoft will notify you before any price changes to your Subscription is effective, in a manner to be determined by Ubisoft in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law.  Unless required by applicable law, the Subscription is non-refundable and non-transferable.

**5**.           **Free Trial**
-------------------------------

Ubisoft may, from time to time provide you access to a free trial of some or all of the Ubisoft+ Services (the “Free Trial”). The duration of, and conditions/restrictions associated with, such Free Trial will be specified on the Subscription page on the Ubisoft Store ([https://store.ubi.com/ubisoftplus](https://store.ubi.com/ubisoftplus)) or on Ubisoft Connect.  Account holders with an existing or previous Subscription may not be eligible for a Free Trial.    Entering a payment method may be required to participate in a Free Trial.  Subject to applicable law, after a Free Trial your Subscription **may automatically renew unless you have cancelled it prior to the end of the Free Trial.  If you have not cancelled your Subscription, Ubisoft will charge the then current monthly Subscription fee to the payment method you chose when subscribing, for the next subscription period/billing cycle.  Please note: your Subscription will auto-renew until you cancel it, pursuant to the conditions set forth in Article 3 above.** 

**6.**           **Cancelling Your Subscription Purchased From Ubisoft**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may cancel your Subscription at any time, and for any reason, by visiting “My Account” at [https://store.ubi.com](https://store.ubi.com) and following the instructions to cancel your Subscription.  After cancellation, you will still have full access to all then current Ubisoft+ Services until the end of the Subscription period in which you cancelled.  After that current Subscription period ends, you will no longer have access to the Ubisoft+ Services, including without limitation, the Early Access, Discounts, Multi-Platform Access, Ubisoft+ Games or any in-game purchases made within a Ubisoft+ Game (unless you have purchased the game and have access to it in your Account separate from Ubisoft+).   Should you not have purchased the game outside of Ubisoft+, Ubisoft may, at its sole discretion, choose to save your progression and/or any in-game purchases should you decide to later renew your Subscription. Should Ubisoft so choose to save your progression, please see [https://support.ubi.com/faqs/000046342](https://support.ubi.com/faqs/000046342) for a list of Ubisoft+ Games for which progression may be saved.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, please note that if you choose to renew a Subscription at a later date, you will only gain access to the _then current_ Ubisoft+ Services. 

**7**.           **Multi-Platform Access** 
-------------------------------------------

Ubisoft may, as a Free Trial or for a fee, enable you to play certain Ubisoft+ Games (and, as applicable, access certain Ubisoft+ Services) on other platforms and/or services via Multi-Platform Access (“Third-Party Platforms”). If you choose to access this Multi-Platform Access, you will need to follow the instructions to link your Ubisoft Account with your account on the Third-Party Platforms (either by logging in to your already existing account or creating one). Any terms that apply to your use of the Third-Party Platforms (including but not limited to the Third-Party Platform’s terms of use and privacy policy) will also apply to your use of the Ubisoft+ Services on the Third-Party Platforms. You are responsible for reading and understanding those terms, which may be updated from time to time, and if you do not agree to them, do not link your Ubisoft Account with those Third-Party Platforms. You may be required by a Third-Party Platform to pay an additional fee in order to access the Third-Party Platforms. Cross-play and cross-progression may be available for certain Ubisoft+ Games and certain Third-Party Platforms; for more information on those features please see [https://support.ubisoft.com/faqs/000059698](https://support.ubisoft.com/faqs/000059698).
