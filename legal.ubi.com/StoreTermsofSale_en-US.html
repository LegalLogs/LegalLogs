<h2>5. Pricing and Payment Methods</h2>
<p><strong>5.1 Pricing.</strong> All prices, discounts and descriptions made available on the Ubisoft Stores are subject to availability, and may be withdrawn or revised at any time. While we try to be as accurate as possible in the descriptions regarding the Ubisoft Products, there may be errors in the information displayed to you. Prices may be indicated on the Ubisoft Store or an order acknowledgement, but the authoritative price in the event of any discrepancy, is the price in effect at the time of Acceptance through the charge placed through your selected payment method. Payment shall be made by the payment method selected during your order completion process. We will charge credit or debit cards on dispatch or commencement of the Ubisoft Product. We reserve the right to verify and/or authorize credit or debit card payments prior to Acceptance. For that reason, we reserve the right to notify you of any errors in Ubisoft Product descriptions or in the Ubisoft Product price prior to the Ubisoft Product dispatch. If the price of a Ubisoft Product is incorrect, regardless of whether it is an error in a price posted on the Ubisoft Store or otherwise communicated to you, then we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to cancel your order and refund to you the amount that you paid, regardless of how the error occurred. Except as expressly provided elsewhere in these Terms of Sale, payment may be taken in full notwithstanding any claim for short delivery or defects.</p>
<p><strong>5.2 Shipping and Handling.</strong> Prices do not include shipping and handling, expedited service, or sales taxes, if applicable, which will be added to your total price. You are responsible for any shipping and handling charges and state and local sales or use taxes that may apply to your order.</p>
<p><strong>5.3 Payment methods.</strong> Ubisoft offers various payment methods on its Ubisoft Stores, some of which are managed by third-party payment and billing providers for which additional terms and costs may apply. Please review such additional terms and costs carefully. You may also be required to create an account with such third-party provider. Ubisoft may, at its sole discretion and without further notice, determine and change the availability of certain payment solutions, from time to time without any liability to you. Ubisoft may share with its technical partners certain of your personal and purchase information, in accordance with the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to suspend and/or revoke your Account and/or to restrict you from placing orders in the Ubisoft Stores and/or to restrict you from using certain payment methods, if we reasonably suspect that you have undertaken (or are attempting/have attempted to undertake) a fraudulent transaction.</p>
<p><strong>5.4 Pre-purchases.</strong> For certain Ubisoft Products which are in development and not yet released, Ubisoft may make such Ubisoft Product available to you for pre-purchase. We may charge you the full price of the Ubisoft Products at the moment of the pre-purchase. In the event you pre-purchased a Ubisoft Product (and provided you were actually charged for such Ubisoft Product), you will be entitled to cancel your pre-purchase and request for a refund at any time before the release of such Ubisoft Product.
