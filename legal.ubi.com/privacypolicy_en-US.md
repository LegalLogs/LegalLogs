**9\.** **Your California privacy rights**
------------------------------------------

This privacy notice for California Residents supplements the information contained in this Privacy Policy and applies to visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California. Consumers residing in California have certain rights with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).

**Collection and Use of Personal Data:** In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of Data: identifiers, personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute, commercial information, internet or other similar network activity, and geolocation data. For examples of more specific information we collect and the sources of such collection, please see Section 3 ‘When does Ubisoft collect your Personal Data and for what purpose?’ in the Privacy Policy. We collect your Data for the business and commercial purposes described in Section 3.

**Disclosure of Personal Data:** We may share your Data with third parties as described in the “How does Ubisoft share your Personal Data?” above. In the preceding 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of your Data for business or commercial purposes: identifiers, personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute, commercial information, internet or other similar network activity, and geolocation data.

**Sale of Data:** California law requires that we provide transparency about your Data we “sell,” which for the purposes of the CCPA, means scenarios in which personal information is shared with third parties/partners in exchange for valuable consideration. In the preceding 12 months, we have “sold” the following categories of your Data, depending on how the CCPA is interpreted: identifiers, personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute, commercial information, internet or other similar network activity, and geolocation data.

**Minors:** We may share or “sell” your personal information as described in Minors of our Privacy Policy.

**Your Rights and Choices****:** Some US states have enacted laws (including the CCPA) that give you the ability to opt out of the sale of your Data to third parties. In effect, this will disable targeted advertising provided by Ubisoft’s third-party partners, which means that Ubisoft will no longer share your Data with third-party partners to customize your advertising experience.

 Ubisoft enables you to do so by using the following privacy controls.
