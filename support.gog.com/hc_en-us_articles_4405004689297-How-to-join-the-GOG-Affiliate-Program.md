How to join the GOG Affiliate Program
=====================================

**HOW TO JOIN THE GOG AFFILIATES PROGRAM**  
The GOG Affiliate Program is open to publishers, influencers and our business partners.

Please note:

*   If you have been a GOG affiliate since before April 2021, you might still be using our legacy affiliates program. The legacy affiliates program has shut down on September 31st, 2021.
*   While we try to fulfil most requests, we currently cannot accept everyone in the GOG Affiliate Program.

Here is how you can join.

1.  Send an email at affiliate@gog.com, letting us know you would like to join the GOG Affiliates Program. Please include a link to your website/channel.
    
2.  Sign-up on AdTraction.com. AdTraction is a 3rd\-party partner and handles all affiliation partnerships for GOG. You will also receive payments from AdTraction.
    
    *   After your account creation, AdTraction will invite you to also register a channel on their platform and will approve said channel within a few days.
        
    *   When registering a channel on AdTraction, check the ‘this is not a website’ box if you do not own the website you are registering (for example, you have a YouTube channel but do not own YouTube.com).

1.  *   If you have several channels (ex: a YouTube channel, a Discord server and a Website), you will need to register an AdTraction channel for each.
        
    *   Should your channel be rejected by AdTraction, please contact us at [affiliate@gog.com](mailto:affiliate@gog.com) with your AdTraction channel ID.
        
2.  After your channel has been approved by AdTraction, you can apply to the GOG Affiliates Program with it. On AdTraction, you will find us in the ‘International’ category. We will approve your channel within a few days.

**WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF THE NEW AFFILIATES PROGRAM?**

*   As an affiliate in the New Program, you get 6% of Net Sales. (Gross - VAT).
    
*   Attribution lasts for 7 days after a click.
    
*   Attribution is on ‘last-click’.
    
*   Refunds are taken into consideration. If a game is refunded, no affiliation share gets paid. As you may know, we have a 30-day refund policy.
    
*   Tracking works cross-device, so a user can start a purchase on Desktop and finish on mobile or GOG Galaxy, and you will still get the affiliate share.
    
*   Tracking works store-wide, in all countries, on all our accepted currencies.
    
*   Transactions get batched monthly and you will receive payouts 70 days after they happen.
    

**HOW TO USE GOG’S NEW AFFILIATES PROGRAM**

*   You can create tracking links in the [GOG.COM](http://GOG.COM) section of your AdTraction dashboard ([https://secure.adtraction.com/affiliate/program.htm?apid=1578845455](https://secure.adtraction.com/affiliate/program.htm?apid=1578845455))

*   If you don’t want to create AdTraction links manually, you can use their ‘Clean Links’ Script on all your pages, so all GOG links are automatically transformed into affiliates links.
    
*   You can also create GOG-branded links! Get your Channel ID from AdTraction and create links as such: [https://af.gog.com/game/diablo?as=your\_adtraction\_channel\_id\_here](https://af.gog.com/game/diablo?as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here). As you can notice, you have to replace ‘www’ with ‘af’. You also have to add your channel ID to your URL, via a ‘as’ parameter. You can chain parameters; for example: [https://af.gog.com/games?sort=popularity&category=role-playing&price=discounted&as=your\_adtraction\_channel\_id\_here](https://af.gog.com/games?sort=popularity&category=role-playing&price=discounted&as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here). 
    
*   If you need a product feed, feel free to use our API. Note that there is a 200 request/hour/IP on the [api.gog.com/products/\*](http://api.gog.com/products/*) endpoint. There is no limit on the V1/games and V2/games
