### 2\. WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY GOVERNS

2.1 This Privacy Policy applies to GOG.COM, your GOG user account, GOG GALAXY (including GOG GALAXY store), any games or videos or other content which you purchase, access or use via GOG.COM, the ‘GOG Wallet’, GOG payment methods, the GOG web forums, GOG customer and technical support and any other services we provide to you (we'll just call all this “GOG services” for short). GWENT: The Witcher Card Game for PC's (“GWENT”) together with www.playgwent.com, any other GWENT web sites or accounts and all services related to GWENT, including (but not limited to) user accounts and customer and technical support (“GWENT Services”) are governed by the separate privacy policy which you can find [here](http://playgwent.com/privacy).

GWENT and GWENT services are under joint controllership of GOG and our related company CD PROJEKT S.A. You can find everything you need to know about our cooperation [here](http://playgwent.com/privacy) (point 10).

This Privacy Policy explains the different types of information that we collect while you use GOG services. When you play GWENT, GOG and CD PROJEKT S.A. process your data together. We and our Trusted Partners will comply with applicable privacy laws. Btw Geralt says hi.

2.2 Specifically, this Privacy Policy governs personal information and non-personal information which we collect from you when you're using GOG services. ("Personal information" means information which, on its own or in combination with other information, can be used to identify you).

2.3 We respect your right to privacy and will only process personal information in accordance with applicable data protection legislation in the EU, the USA (including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and elsewhere.

We will comply with applicable data protection laws. This involves us being responsible for personal data which we use in connection with GOG services and equally our Trusted Partners (see opposite) will be responsible for personal data which they use in connection with GOG services.

2.4 GOG works with trusted partners, including our related company CD PROJEKT S.A., developers and publishers, payment providers, customer service software providers and others (“Trusted Partners”) – more on them later in this Policy.

2.5 For personal information contained in this Privacy Policy which is used by GOG, GOG is the data controller under EU data protection legislation.

### 3\. PROTECTING CHILDREN

3.1 We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We do not and will not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 16. If for any reason we decide to collect personal information of children between 13 and 16 we will ask for their parent or guardian consent. If you are a parent or guardian's and are concerned about the transfer of personal information about your child, please contact privacy@GOG.COM

We will not knowingly collect personal information about children under 16.  
  

### 4\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

4.1 When you register a GOG account with us, you will need to provide us: (a) your username; (b) your email address; and (c) a password (which is encrypted so that we don’t have access to it). This information is necessary for us to provide you with a GOG account requested by you. In your GOG account settings you can also set your date of birth, avatar, and your geographical location. This information will be protected by your GOG account password. You are responsible for keeping it safe - please don't share it with anyone.

To register a GOG account, we will ask you for and collect some basic personal information, including username and email. We need this to provide you with a GOG account. Keep your GOG account password safe.

4.2 When you use GOG services we may also collect the following information (how we use it is described later in this document):

We may also collect additional information when you use other GOG services (see opposite).

*   (a) Technical details about devices which you use to access GOG services, including: Internet and/or network connection (including your IP address); mobile device identifiers; your operating system, browser type or other software; your hardware details; or other technical details provided by your web browser. This is technical data about our users and their actions and patterns, which does not provide personal information;

4.3 GOG GALAXY. If you use GOG GALAXY (including GOG GALAXY store) we will also collect technical logs, information about achievements in games you play and how long you play them; your multiplayer sessions and your activities in the GOG GALAXY app and on other platforms connected to your GOG account for the general operational purposes of GOG GALAXY. If you choose to connect your accounts from other platforms with GOG GALAXY, depending on the features that the particular integration currently supports, GOG will access personal and non-personal information such as your user name and user ID, avatar, game list, gametime, game achievements, friend list (user name, user ID, avatar) and their status, chat and conversation history. We will not store your account credentials. In addition, if you purchase games using GOG GALAXY store, we will collect information related to your transaction mentioned in point (d) above as well as the relevant product ID and product entitlement ID. You can read more about this optional account connecting feature in our GOG GALAXY Application Privacy Notice [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/360023620554). The Privacy Notice forms part of this Privacy Policy.

When you use GOG GALAXY, GOG collects personal and non-personal information about your activity (specific examples opposite). We need this to run GOG GALAXY and to provide you with its cool features.

4.4 A quick word about bug reports and crash logs: GOG software will generate bug or crash reports regarding GOG services – these reports will not mention your personal information. You can decide whether to submit these reports to GOG automatically. If you manually submit bug or crash reports to us, or if we contact you asking for feedback regarding crash or bug reports, then we may store them alongside your personal information.

If GOG services crash, we might ask you to send us crash logs/bug reports.

4.5 A quick word about payment details (if/when you use them in GOG services): this is a matter for the relevant payment method/platform/processor. We process only limited payment processing information on a hashed/anonymised basis as applicable. If you make any purchases within GOG services, then we are notified by the payment processor once a transaction takes place and of course we make sure you receive your purchased item, but we will not receive any of your actual payment details.

Please know that community integrations may be governed by separate private policies and we are not responsible for their use of your personal and non-personal information (see further section 5 of the GOG GALAXY Licence Agreement).

If you use GOG GALAXY and choose to link your accounts from other platforms to GOG GALAXY we may collect your personal and non-personal information from third parties via GOG official or community integrations (see details opposite).  
  

### 6\. COOKIES

We also collect information about you via cookies. You can find out more about this in our Cookie Policy [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000498685-Cookie-Policy).

Check out our Cookie Policy and Cookie Declaration (links opposite).

### 7\. WHY DO WE USE YOUR DATA? (LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DATA PROCESSING)

7.1. When we process information about you, we do so as necessary to provide GOG services you use (i.e. to perform agreement between us, enable you to play GWENT or use GOG GALAXY features), meet our legal obligations (f.ex. tax, accounting) or to fulfill the so-called “legitimate interests” of GOG or other reasons described in the “How we use your data” section. To clarify, by legitimate interests we mean lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected (like informing you about games we distribute and making sure our marketing is relevant for you, protecting the security of our websites and systems, conducting anti-cheat analysis and anti-fraud checks). When we rely on the legitimate interest, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes we will ask for your consent and you will be entitled to withdraw this consent any time, with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn.

In essence, we process your data to provide you with GOG services, to meet our legal obligations and for other reasons that are important for us like informing you about our games and ensuring security of our website. In other cases, we will ask for your consent in advance and you will always have the right to withdraw it anytime you like.

7.2 When we transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area, we do so on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in “Trusted Partners”.  
  

### 8\. HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION

8.1 All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our Trusted Partners. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage.

All information you provide to us is stored either on our secure servers or those of our Trusted Partners.

8.2 How long are we going to keep your data? We will retain your personal information only for as long as we will be required in order to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain special cases, a longer retention period might be required by law e.g. tax, accounting purposes or other legal requirements and obligations. As soon as we will no longer require your personal data to provide our services for other purposes mentioned above, we will promptly delete or anonymize it. In particular:

*   (a) we will keep information that is associated with your GOG account for the duration of your agreement for the access to GOG services (i.e. until you close your GOG account). If you choose to close your GOG account, limited data that we collect about you may still be retained for tax, legal and accounting purposes;
*   (b) if you don’t have a GOG account and contact us we will retain correspondence with you as long as necessary to help you out and then for the period necessary for legal or accountability purposes;
*   (c) information that you post on our public forums and your game reviews will be retained until you decide that it should be removed as well. We don’t want to interfere with your posts and expressions without your permission.
*   (d) if you use GOG GALAXY and connect your accounts from other platforms with GOG GALAXY we’ll be storing your imported data only as long as you stay connected with the relevant platform. This information will be deleted once you disconnect with the platform or anytime you ask us to delete your data. However, if you purchased any content via GOG GALAXY Store, we will need to retain your payment history, product ID and entitlement ID for tax, legal and accounting purposes.

In general, we’ll store your data until you close your GOG account. If you do, we may still use limited information about you for tax, legal or accounting purposes.

### 9\. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

9.1 We will use the above information in the following ways:

*   (a) to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us, like providing access to your GOG account, providing you with the games and technical support and in general allowing to use GOG services and its functionalities when you choose to do so f. ex. your GOG user profile, chat, forum or cloud saving and crossplay services in GOG GALAXY;
*   (b) to ensure that GOG services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or other device from which you access GOG services;

*   (n) for tax, legal and accounting purposes;

We will use your information to run GOG and keep improving it as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails). Sometimes we may have to share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types in order to run GOG services.

9.2. Whenever we’re personalizing or targeting our marketing communications, offers and adverts, we may profile your personal information. However, we do not make automated decisions (f.ex. via algorithms) that could affect your legal situation. If you decide that you no longer want to receive personalized offers, product recommendations from us, or no advertising news at all, you can object to this at any time. You can also choose whether to receive marketing communication from us, including personalized and targeted marketing emails by managing subscriptions on your GOG Account Subscription page, following the link "unsubscribe" attached to our marketing emails or just contacting us directly here.

9.4 Non-personal data. We might process some aggregated and general non-personal data on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region, number of support tickets) and share it with Trusted Partners who work with us to provide GOG services to you (for example, with games developers/publishers selling games on GOG.COM or with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend GOG services or to help them to improve their products, which you have bought. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run GOG.COM. Fear not, as mentioned above, everything’s anonymised, so you cannot be identified.

### 10\. DATA SHARINGS

### Other Users

10.1 Some elements of your personal information and some information about your use of GOG services are accessible to other GOG users. For example: other users of GOG services will be able to see your username and avatar (if you choose to have one). We may also display other information derived from your activity on GOG services. We do this to help GOG users to find gamers with similar tastes and to build the GOG user community. You can manage the privacy settings of your GOG user profile in your GOG account.

Some information about you will be visible on GOG.COM as a part of your GOG user profile, this can be managed via privacy settings for your GOG account.

Use of the reCAPTCHA service is subject to the Google [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of Use.](https://policies.google.com/terms)

10.6 Your information may be processed, stored and transferred outside your country of residence and beyond the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, such as the United States, Canada or Brazil. Privacy laws in these countries may not offer the same level of protection as in your country or in the EEA. But whenever we’re sharing your personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses and/or other lawful measures to transfer your data and establish adequate protection of your personal information

### 11\. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND EXTERNAL SERVICES

11.1 GOG services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties (e.g. to games developers whose games are on GOG). In addition, third parties (e.g. games developers/publishers) may also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. your email address or name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. This may include saving information to your GOG profile in relation to their games (such as, for example, saving game progress). Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies. This also applies to GOG GALAXY integrations created by the community.

You may find links on GOG.COM that lead outside our website. Sometimes we might need to direct you elsewhere (like a developer’s website) if you want to access additional features built into your games. These sites might collect your information under their own privacy policies.

11.2 GOG services may also offer you easy and optional access to GOG-approved Trusted Partners’ services, e.g. the websites and games provided by our related company CD PROJEKT. In order to do this, we will need to share some of your personal information (e.g. your email address) with them, as long as you agree to it. This personal information will be protected under our Trusted Partner’s privacy policy.

You can use GOG services to access cool stuff from GOG-approved Trusted Partners. We will need to share some personal information with them (which you control). It is up to you if you want to use your GOG account for this or not.

11.3 A quick word about GOG Connect (which you can read more about [here](https://www.gog.com/connect)). In order for us to provide this (optional) feature to you, we will need access to Valve’s service allowing us to retrieve certain data regarding Steam and games available via Steam (“Steam Data”). We will treat the Steam Data consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will only retrieve Steam Data regarding your Steam account as requested by you and we will notify you what if any Steam Data is stored by us. We will not intercept, store or use your Steam password or login. In accordance with Valve’s requirements, Steam Data is provided: (I) "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VALVE, STEAM GAME PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. VALVE, STEAM GAME PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, STATUTORY AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION (A) WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, ACCURACY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, NO ENCUMBRANCES, NO LIENS AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, (B) WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS ARISING THROUGH COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, AND (C) WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE ACCESS OR USE. (II) IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE OR ANY SUPPLIER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM ITS API TERMS OF USE OR YOUR USE OF STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, OR VALVE BRAND & LINKS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH IS INDEPENDENT OF YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND SURVIVES IN THE EVENT SUCH REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM (A) BREACH OF CONTRACT, (B) BREACH OF WARRANTY, (C) NEGLIGENCE, OR (D) ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THE ABOVE, OR YOU HAVE ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM AGAINST VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, AND VALVE BRAND & LINKS.

If you’d like to use our GOG Connect feature, we’ll require access to your “Steam Data” (more info opposite). There are some legal rules that Valve requires us to follow.  
  

### 12\. OTHER STUFF

12.1 Please be aware that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to release personal information to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements.

We might be required to comply with law enforcement requests to release personal information.
