        <p>Games in Development are playable games, but they're not finished just yet: They might be in the final stages of gameplay improvements or still getting new major features. The important thing is that they're all works in progress â€” it's good to feel comfortable with their current state when making your purchase. After all, there is no rush.</p>
<p>Just in case, our refund policy allows for a full refund on all games in development within 30 days of purchase. More on this below.</p>
