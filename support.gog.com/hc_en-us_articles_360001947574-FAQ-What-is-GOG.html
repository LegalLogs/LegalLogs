        <p><strong>What is GOG about?</strong></p>
<p>We're a digital distribution platform with a curated selection of games, a "you buy it, you own it" philosophy, and utmost care about customers.<br>â†’<a href="https://www.gog.com/about_gog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about GOG</a></p>
<p><br><strong>How do I contact GOG's support?</strong></p>
<p>To open a support ticket, please use our support ticket form, which you can find by clicking <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. After you submit your request, you will receive an email confirmation to the address you provided; if you don't receive such a confirmation message within a few minutes, please check your spam folder in case it was accidentally marked as spam.</p>
<p>Our customer support team will reply to you via email, but you can also check your support tickets by clicking <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, though&nbsp;this requires you to be logged in to the help center with your GOG account.</p>
<p>If you want to update one of your support tickets, you can do so by replying to the last email you received about this request. If the ticket has already been closed, replying to the last email will automatically create a new support ticket.</p>
<p>Our customer support team never closes a support ticket without an answer, and even though we do our best to reply within 24 hours of receiving your request, sometimes it may take longer for especially complicated issues or during times of high traffic.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>So what's with this DRM thing? </strong></p>
<p>DRM or Digital Rights Management is a kind of copy protection technology used by many companies to limit the usage of digital media. Although designed to stop pirates from creating illegal copies, in reality the only people who are hurt are the legitimate consumers, stripped of their fair use rights, such as the ability to make backup copies.</p>
<p>We believe that a DRM-free world would be a better place and that's why you won't find any DRMs or other intrusive copy protection in items available at GOG. This applies to both games and movies.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Is GOG available in my country?</strong></p>
<p>GOG is available to everyone, everywhere and at any time (except for scheduled maintenance, of course). We do not block you from accessing our store based on your country.</p>
