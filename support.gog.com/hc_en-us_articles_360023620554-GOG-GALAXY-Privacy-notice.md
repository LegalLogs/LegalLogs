GOG GALAXY Privacy notice
=========================

### GOG GALAXY Application Privacy notice

Hello! We’re GOG and we develop the GOG GALAXY app. We’re based in Poland (ul. Jagiellońska 74, 03-301 Warsaw). This Privacy Notice is meant to help you understand what information we collect via GOG GALAXY, why we collect it, how long do we keep it and how you can manage it.

**The information we get access to and we collect**

You can connect your GOG account with your accounts from other platforms (we’ll call these “other accounts” throughout this notice). This is an optional feature. You can check your other accounts by opening GOG GALAXY and going to settings > platforms > integrations. If you choose to link any of your other accounts, GOG will get access to your personal and non-personal information such as your user name and user id, avatar, game list, game time, game achievements, friend list (user name, user id, avatar) and their status, chat and conversation history. The exact set of information will depend on the current features of the particular integration being used for that connection. We will not store your other account login credentials (e.g. your email address or password). If you connect your GOG account to your other accounts, we may give you an option to buy certain games using GOG GALAXY which are activated and run on other platforms - we call it the GOG GALAXY store. If you purchase a game via the GOG GALAXY store which can be activated and run on other platforms, we will process your payment details and collect some additional information from the applicable platform (i.e. the relevant product id and product activation id) in order to activate your purchased game on that platform.

**How do we use this information?**

We will only use information from your other accounts to the extent required to provide you with the GOG GALAXY features (e.g. to allow you to organize your game libraries as one master collection together with game time and achievements, to create one list of your gaming friends with the ability to chat with them cross-platform and to activate your purchased games on other platforms).

**How long do we keep this information?**

You can disconnect any of the other accounts that you have linked to your GOG account at any time (like we said, it’s optional). Please note though that disconnecting your other accounts may deactivate or limit certain features of GOG GALAXY (e.g. if you disconnect one of your other accounts, the games from that other account will no longer be shown in your game library in GOG GALAXY). If you decide to disconnect any of your other accounts, we will automatically delete any information we hold in relation to the disconnected accounts. If you’ve purchased any game via the GOG GALAXY store though, we may need to retain limited information (i.e. payment history, product id, and activation id) for tax, legal and accounting purposes – we’ll delete or anonymize this information as soon as we no longer require it for these limited purposes.

**Do we share this information?**

We’re not sharing and we won’t be sharing your personal information with third parties via GOG GALAXY, unless you’ve provided this information to the third party directly or we need to do so in order to provide the GOG GALAXY features you asked us to deliver to you. For example, if you have purchased any game via the GOG GALAXY store, we may need to share limited information (e.g. your other platform user id, product id, and product activation id) with the applicable other platform in order to activate your purchased game on that platform.

**Your rights**

We respect your privacy rights (i.e. the right to access, correct, and delete information about you or the right to limit processing only to certain operations). You may also ask us to provide you with a copy of your information or tell us you do not want us to process it at all.

**Third-party content**

If you are using community integrations, please be aware that they are unofficial open-source integrations created by the GOG GALAXY community, not by GOG. They might collect personal and non-personal information of their own, for which the community integration creator would be responsible and might provide their own privacy policy. There’s more information about community integrations in section 5 of the [GOG GALAXY Licence Agreement](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/360023617474?product=galaxy).
