        <p><strong>What are games in development?</strong></p>
<p>Games in Development are playable games, but they're not finished just yet: they might be in the final stages of gameplay improvements or still getting new major features. The important thing is that they're all works in progress — it's good to feel comfortable with their current state when making your purchase. After all, there is no rush.</p>
<p>Just in case, our refund policy allows for a full refund on all games in development within 30 days of purchase. More on this below.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Is this different from early access?</strong></p>
<p>Early access means the opportunity to try games early and participate in community-driven development, as well as the chance to support a game's production.</p>
<p>Our take on games in development is all of those things, with the additional benefits of the GOG way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> — When choosing the games that are a good fit for GOG, we make sure to pick the ones we can truly stand behind.</li>
<li><strong> 30-day refund policy</strong> — You can download, play, and refund any game in development within 30 days of purchase - no questions asked.</li>
<li><strong> Rollback in GOG GALAXY</strong> — Keep playing your game if the newest update is not doing it for you, or revisit historical version snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>The games are DRM-free</strong> — No annoyances, no online checks.</li>
</ul>
<p><br><br><strong>How can I find games in development on GOG?</strong></p>
<p>All games in development will feature an [IN DEV] tag in our catalog. You'll also find additional information about the program, as well as links to the game's subforum and developer statements, directly on the game's store page.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>What is the refund policy for games in development?</strong></p>
<p>In short: 30 days, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Because the games are unfinished software, games in development fall under a separate refund policy. Technical issues covered by the 30 Day Money Back Guarantee do not apply to games in development. Instead, you can return the game within 30 days of your purchase - no questions asked. Your refund can be processed in GOG Wallet funds or the currency you used to make the purchase.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Do you offer technical support for games in development?</strong></p>
<p>We'll do our best. You can always contact us for technical support with all games in development, and we'll try to help you or forward your issue to the developers. These games are still being developed and changing constantly, so when in trouble, the best and fastest way to get help can be among the devs and community.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>How often will the games be updated?</strong></p>
<p>This is always up to the developer, but we're working closely with all of our partners to deliver all patches in a timely manner.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>How can I get a better sense of what's to come during development?</strong></p>
<p>Check out the game's forums for a better idea of where the game is heading, and a chance to talk to the devs about the future of their game.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>How can I contact the devs and offer my input?</strong></p>
<p>Check out the game-specific subforum if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to talk about the game. You can simply search through the forums, or head there directly from the product page.</p>
