### **FAQ**

**Do I need to have purchased a game in order to write a review of it?** 

No, it is not required. This allows you to write a review about a game you may have played on a different platform. However, please keep in mind that if you do not have the game in your GOG library, your review will not have the 'Verified owner' tag. 

**Can I write a negative review?** 

Yes. If you are unsatisfied with the game (e.g. the gameplay, graphics, in-game mechanics and features) you are free to write a review and share your opinion with other GOG users as to why you do not recommend it. 

**What kind of content is considered unacceptable in a review?**

Your reviews should be about the game you are writing your review about, constructive and polite. Please refrain from using language that may be considered offensive, inappropriate, or abusive. 

**Can I rate reviews?**

Yes, if you find a review to be helpful, you can use the 'yes' button (visible at the bottom of every review) to rate it positively. You can also use the 'no' button to rate the review negatively. 

**Can I report abusive reviews?** 

Yes, if you see a review that is violating the guidelines please [contact us](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?=true&form=other&product=gog).
