<li><strong>How does your updated Voluntary Refund Policy work?</strong><br>The updated policy lets you refund a product up to 30 days after purchase, even if it was downloaded, launched, and played. Yes, you read that correctly. :)<br>To apply for a refund, start from <a href="https://www.gog.com/account/settings/orders?source=article" target="_self" rel="undefined">your account's Order History page</a>, find the appropriate order and click "Ask for a refund". For more detailed instructions <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011314978-How-do-I-refund-a-game-?product=gog#howto">click here.</a><br>However, if the reason you are seeking a refund is that your game is not working (yet!), please consider <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=technical">contacting our friendly Tech Support folk</a> first. They will do their best to help you get the game working on your machine.<br>We're monitoring the effects of the current update to make sure no one is using this policy to hurt the developers that put their time and heart into making great games. We may refuse refunds in such individual cases. We'd also let you know about any future adjustments in the voluntary Refund Policy in advance.</li>
<li><strong>How long does it take to process a refund?</strong><br>When you apply for a refund, we can give you two options - a conversion into GOG Wallet funds, or a cash refund back to your original payment method.<br>GOG Wallet refunds will be applied as soon as a GOG Support representative triggers the refund.<br>Cash refunds can take a few business days, depending on the exact payment method used, your bank, etc. There are some exceptions, such as paysafecard, SOFORT, and GiroPay - for technical reasons, these transactions need to be fully processed before they can be refunded; this can take up to a few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>I received a gift from a friend. Can I apply for a refund?</strong><br>We can only offer a cash or GOG Wallet refund to the person who purchased the gift. If the person who purchased the gift prefers to receive a full refund, this is possible, however, they should contact us about this separately.</li>
<li><strong>What about pre-orders?</strong><br>Pre-orders can be refunded throughout their pre-order period (as in - until they get released), and for 30 days after their release date.</li>
<li><strong>What about Games in Development?</strong><br>We're extending the refund time for Game in Development titles to 30 days after purchase, just like for any other game.</li>
<li><strong>What about game packs and DLCs?</strong><br>For technical reasons, we cannot divide a game pack (for instance, a season pass, a pack containing the base game and its DLCs, or a pack containing a whole series of games). As a result, you would get a refund for the full pack and, as a consequence, the full pack will be removed from your account.<br>If you apply for a refund for a DLC, and it was not purchased as a pack (bundled with the base game), we can issue a refund for the DLC itself.<br>If you refund the base game, but also purchased DLCs separately, we would also refund the DLCs linked to that base game.</li>
<li><strong>How often can I refund my games? Is there some sort of limit?</strong><br>We trust that you're making informed purchasing decisions and will use this updated voluntary Refund Policy only if something doesn't work as you expected.<br>We reserve the right to refuse refunds, or only offer Wallet Funds conversions, in individual cases.<br>Please respect all the time and hard work put into making the games you play and remember that refunds are not reviews. If you finished the game and didn't like it, please consider sharing your opinion instead. Also, please don't take advantage of our trust by asking for an unreasonable amount of games to be refunded. Don't be that person. No one likes that person.</li>
<li><strong>What if my country provides additional rights?</strong><br>Just let us know. We respect regional laws, to learn more see sections 7.1. and 7.2. of the <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212632089-GOG-COM-User-Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG User Agreement.</a></li>
