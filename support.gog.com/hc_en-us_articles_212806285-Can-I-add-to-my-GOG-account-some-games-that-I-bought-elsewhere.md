Can I add to my GOG account some games that I bought elsewhere?
===============================================================

We've introduced a number of solutions for this, including:  
[Witcher backup](https://www.gog.com/witcher/backup),  
the [/reclaim/ games program](https://www.gog.com/reclaim),  
[Master of Orion reclaim via email](https://www.gog.com/news/master_of_orion_updated_reclaim_your_master_of_orion_1_2_and_3_retail_copies),  
the [GOG Connect program](https://www.gog.com/connect).

**Important Notes:**  
The game you redeem here is subject to the EULA provided with the GOG.COM version of the game.  
If a similar campaign is made available elsewhere, your key won't be redeemable again.

**Is every game code redeemable here?**  
Only select game keys are redeemable. You can find the complete list of supported games and editions on the right. For Torchlight and Torchlight 2, only game keys that were purchased directly from Runicgames.com can be redeemed. This DOES NOT include Steam keys.

**Which key do I use? I found several in the box.**  
You can check the list of participating titles for more information on which key to use. Various keys have their specific structures.  
StarForce:  
XXXX-XXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX  
XX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX  
GameSpy:  
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX  
If your key doesn't work, double-check that you wrote down the key exactly as it is written (including hypens and capital letters) and that you didn't mix up your 0 and O.

**Will you include more titles in the future?**  
We're doing our best to add more games. Stay tuned for future updates and announcements as soon as we know more.

**I bought one of the games before you launched this page, can I get a refund?**  
As usual, we can't offer refunds on account of giveaways or promotions. You can always give your spare key to a friend, and point them to this page.

**Can I get a refund for the game I reclaimed?**  
We're treating this as we would any normal giveaway, we can only offer refunds for games you paid for. If you encounter any issues with your game, get in touch with our customer support and we'll do our best to get them resolved.

**Will I receive just what was in my game box, or the entire corresponding product from the GOG.COM catalog?**  
You will get the exact same game thatâ€™s available for purchase on GOG.COM. That includes every available bonus goodie and all future updates.

**My game version is listed and I'm doing everything right. Why can't I reclaim my game?**  
We've done our best to acquire the most complete, up-to-date key databases of retail versions for the eligible titles, and we have nearly everything covered. Still, sometimes data can go missing, backups can be outdated, and (since we're dealing with pretty old databases here) plenty of things can simply go wrong. If your game key should be eligible but doesn't work, you can always try again in the future.
