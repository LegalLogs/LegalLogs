Can I add to my GOG account some games that I bought elsewhere?
===============================================================

We've introduced a number of solutions for this, including:  
[Witcher backup](https://www.gog.com/witcher/backup),  
the [/reclaim/ games program](https://www.gog.com/reclaim),  
[Master of Orion reclaim via email](https://www.gog.com/news/master_of_orion_updated_reclaim_your_master_of_orion_1_2_and_3_retail_copies),  
the [GOG Connect program](https://www.gog.com/connect).  
  
Please follow the links above to learn more about which games you can reclaim, and how.
