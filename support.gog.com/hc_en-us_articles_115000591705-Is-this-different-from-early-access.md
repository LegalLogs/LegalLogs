Is this different from early access?
====================================

Early access means the opportunity to try games early and participate in community-driven development, as well as the chance to support a game's production.

Our take on games in development is all of those things, with the additional benefits of the GOG way:

*   **Quality over quantity** — When choosing the games that are a good fit for GOG, we make sure to pick the ones we can truly stand behind.
*    **30-day refund policy** — You can download, play, and refund any game in development within 30 days of purchase - no questions asked.
*    **Rollback in GOG GALAXY** — Keep playing your game if the newest update is not doing it for you, or revisit historical version snapshots.
*   **The games are DRM-free** — No annoyances, no online checks.
