GOG GALAXY Application Privacy notice (effective until November 5 2020)
=======================================================================

Hello! We’re GOG and we make GOG GALAXY 2.0. We’re based in Poland (ul. Jagiellońska 74, 03-301 Warsaw).

You can connect GOG GALAXY 2.0. to accounts from other platforms. This is an optional but cool feature. If you choose to link any of your accounts, depending on the current features of the particular integration being used for that connection, GOG access personal and non-personal information such as your user name and user id, avatar, game list, gametime, game achievements, friend list (user name, user id, avatar) and their status, chat and conversation history. We will not store your account credentials.

We will use only data that is required to provide you with the GOG GALAXY 2.0 features – i.e. to allow you to organize your game libraries as one master collection together with playtime and achievements and to create one list of your gaming friends with the ability to chat with them cross-platform. For the same purposes, we may combine information about your gameplay and friends with your information on GOG Galaxy 2.0.

You can disconnect at any time (like we said it’s optional but cool). We’ll be storing your imported data only as long as you stay connected with the relevant platform. This information will be deleted once you disconnect with the platform or anytime you ask us to delete your data.

We’re not sharing and we won’t be sharing your personal information with third parties via GOG GALAXY 2.0, unless you’ve provided this data to the third party directly.

We respect your privacy rights i.e. the right to access, correct and delete information about you or the right to limit processing only to certain operations. You may also ask us to transfer your data or tell us you do not want us to process it at all.

**If you are using community integrations, please be aware that they are unofficial open source integrations created by the GOG GALAXY 2.0 community, not by GOG. They might collect personal and non-personal information of their own, for which the community integration creator would be responsible and might supply their own privacy policy. There’s more information about community integrations at section 5 of the [GOG GALAXY Licence Agreement](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/360023617474).**
