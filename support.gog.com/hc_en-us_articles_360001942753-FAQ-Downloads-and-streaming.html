        <p><strong>How do I download my purchased items, and are my redownloads somehow limited?</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you complete the checkout process, you will be redirected to an order confirmation screen with a list of purchased items, and a link to your "<a href="https://www.gog.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My account</a>" page. If you ever want to redownload anything, or watch a movie instantly, that's the place you want to visit.<br>Also, there is no limit to the number of redownloads, but please remember that you're not allowed to share your GOG account with other users as only you are entitled to download items from your account.</p>
<p>For more information on the download methods which are available on GOG, please check <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/213148105-How-do-I-download-my-purchased-items-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this support article</a>. You can also find more information regarding downloads in <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001945934-FAQ-Delivery?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this FAQ</a>.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Can I re-download my purchased items?</strong></p>
<p>You can download your purchased items as many times as you want; we do not impose a limit on the number of downloads for your purchases. However, please keep in mind that you are not allowed to share your GOG account with other users, as only you are entitled to download items from your account.</p>
<p>If you would like to re-download one of your purchased items and you are unsure how to do that, you can find download instructions in <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/213148105-How-do-I-download-my-purchased-items-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this support article</a>.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>How do I get my free downloadable bonus content?</strong></p>
<p>An item's bonus content becomes available as a free download after you purchase that item. To download it, visit your "<a href="https://www.gog.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My account</a>" page. There, in either the "Games" or "Movies" section, you will find a list of all your purchased items as well as all the downloads available for them. If you're using the "shelf view", click an item's box art to reveal the list.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Can I watch movies right after I buy them, or do I have to download them first? </strong></p>
<p>We would generally advise downloading the whole movie to your hard drive beforehand, as this will always guarantee the highest quality, disruption-free viewing experience. Internet connections are really fast nowadays, but you never know when your connection might get interrupted.<br>That being said, you can also watch a movie instantly, through streaming. Just find the game in your movie library, select it and click "Start watching now".</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Do I need some launcher application to play my GOG games?</strong></p>
<p>No, you don't need any additional apps or launchers. All games downloaded from GOG are wrapped in a nice self-executable (.exe) setup file, some of the larger ones are accompanied by binary files. So after you've completed the download, just double-click on the .exe file to install the game on your hard drive. After the installation is complete, shortcuts will be added to your Start Menu, desktop and Games Explorer, so you can launch your game just like any other.<br>As for movies, you can either stream them directly from the site, or download them as .mp4 files, which you can then play with your favorite video player.</p>
<p>However, if you want the convenience and additional functionalities of a an application, you can use GOG GALAXY. You can learn more about it <a href="https://www.gog.com/galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. This app is entirely optional and not required to install, play, or manage your games, but it offers additional functionalities like automatic updates for games, achievements, and cloud saves for select games.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>I'm having a problem with my downloaded items. Now what?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical issues with games:</strong> If you're experiencing any problems with installation, launching, crashes or other in-game errors, please visit our <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/categories/201400969-Game-Technical-Issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Technical Issues</a> section. There you'll find a list of all known problems and their solutions, including general solutions for common hardware or system-related issues. If your problem isn't listed there, contact our Support team via the "Contact Us" link at the bottom of the help center. Please include as much information as possible, including steps that you've taken so far, error messages, screenshots, etc.</p>
<p><br><strong>Other problems with games:</strong> If your game is working fine, but you're stuck on some level and looking for help or tips, we recommend visiting the forums. Each game has a dedicated forum where other fans could help you out.</p>
<p><br><strong>Problems with viewing downloaded movies:</strong> Make sure that you've installed a reliable codec pack, like K-Lite. If you're using a third-party video player, try using a different one instead, like VLC or Media Player Classic.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>Can I enjoy my purchases both on my laptop and desktop computer at home?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We do not limit the number of installations or reinstallations, as long as you install your purchased games on computers in your household. So yeah, if you've got a render-farm in the basement, you might actually break the world record for the number of legal Witcher installations in one household. However, if you think about installing your game on a friend's machine or sharing it with others then please don't do it, okay? The same principle applies to movies - you're free to watch them anywhere you want, with anyone you want, as long as you don't share them with people who haven't purchased them.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>I have paid for a game but it isn't listed on my account? What now?</strong></p>
<p>Usually this issue is caused by two different problems:<br>If you weren't redirected to an order success screen after paying for your order, but you did receive a confirmation email for your purchase, then it is likely that your GOG account wasn't refreshed properly. You can manually refresh your account by clicking <a href="http://GOG.COM/user/refresh" target="_self" rel="undefined">here</a>, after which the game should be available in your library.</p>
<p>If you weren't redirected to an order success screen after paying for your order and you also haven't received any confirmation email, please double-check if your payment method of choice was actually charged. If this is the case, please contact us so we can investigate the issue and, if needed, manually process your order.</p>
