        <p><strong>How do I buy something as a gift?</strong></p>
<p>Gifting allows you to purchase an item, or items, available at GOG for your friend. To use the gifting option, first proceed like you would with any other purchase, and go to checkout. Make sure to check the "gift this order" option, on the right side of the checkout page. This order just became a gift order and, after you input the recipient's e-mail address and pay for the order, a gift e-mail will be sent to the gift recipient.<br>There are some restrictions for purchasing gifts on new accounts, depending on the payment method used.</p>
<p>But please be aware of our gift restrictions, especially if your GOG account has just been recently created (more information <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212159529-I-cannot-buy-a-game-as-a-gift-why-?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).<br><br><br><strong>I received a gift. How do I redeem it?</strong></p>
<p>A gift code can be purchased by selecting the "Select to gift this order" option, during checkout. You can either send it directly to the recipient, in a GOG-made e-mail, or send it to yourself, and then forward or PM it to someone. The gift recipient will be able to choose which items from the gift they want to add to their account. By default, if the gift recipient already owns some of the items within the gift, these will remain in that gift, and can later on be redeemed by someone else.</p>
<p>To redeem a gift code, click the cogwheel symbol in the top left →Add games &amp; friends →Redeem a GOG code. Or redeem it <a href="https://www.gog.com/redeem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on our website.</p>
<p><br><br><strong>How do I know if the gift certificate has been redeemed by the recipient?</strong></p>
<p>For monitoring the status of purchased gifts, use in your orders history the filters "Redeemed Gifts" and "Unredeemed Gifts". As soon as the recipient redeems the gift you've purchased, it will be marked as “added to account” and the recipient's GOG username will be visible next to it.</p>
