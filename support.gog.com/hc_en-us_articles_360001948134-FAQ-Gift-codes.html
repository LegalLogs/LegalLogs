        <h2><strong>How do I buy something as a gift?</strong></h2>
<p>Gifting allows you to purchase an item, or items, available at GOG for your friend. To use the gifting option, proceed like you would with any other purchase, and go to checkout. Make sure to check the "<strong>GIFT THIS ORDER"</strong> option, below the payment options.</p>
<p><strong><img src="/hc/article_attachments/4402679951249/howtobuyagift__1_.gif" alt="howtobuyagift__1_.gif"></strong></p>
<p>This order just became a gift order and, after you input the recipient's e-mail address and pay for it, a gift e-mail will be sent to the indicated recipient.</p>
<p><img src="/hc/article_attachments/4402679967377/gift_conf_EN.PNG" alt="gift_conf_EN.PNG"></p>
<p>You can either send it directly to the recipient, in a GOG-made e-mail, or send it to yourself, and then forward or PM it to someone. The gift recipient will be able to choose which items from the gift they want to add to their account. By default, if the gift recipient already owns some of the items within the gift, these will remain in that gift, and can later on be redeemed by someone else.<br><br></p>
<p>But please be aware of our gift restrictions, especially if your GOG account has just been recently created (more information <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212159529-I-cannot-buy-a-game-as-a-gift-why-?product=gog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>).<br><br></p>
<h2><strong>How much does a gift cost?</strong></h2>
<p>Gifts purchased in our store can be redeemed globally. For this reason, they have a region-free price, which might be slightly higher than the regional one.</p>
<p>This has been introduced to prevent the abuse of regional pricing. Thanks for your understanding!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How does a gift look like?</strong></h2>
<p>The gift message sent to the recipient includes: your GOG username, the e-mail address associated with your GOG account, the redeemable code, an optional message and the gift's contents (game title &amp; cover).</p>
<p>Here's an example message:</p>
<p><img src="/hc/article_attachments/360018338418/gift_preview.png" alt="gift_preview.png" width="512" height="459"></p>
<h2><strong><br>I received a gift. How do I redeem it?</strong></h2>
<p>To redeem a gift code in GOG GALAXY, click the cogwheel icon in the top left →Add games &amp; friends →Redeem a GOG code. Or redeem it <a href="https://www.gog.com/redeem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on our website.</p>
<h2><br><strong>How do I know if the gift certificate has been redeemed by the recipient?</strong></h2>
<p>For monitoring the status of purchased gifts, use in your orders history the filters "Redeemed Gifts" and "Unredeemed Gifts". As soon as the recipient redeems the gift you've purchased, it will be marked as “added to account” and the recipient's GOG username will be visible next to it.</p>
