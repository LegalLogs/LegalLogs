FAQ: Website and accounts
=========================

**Do I need a user account?**

Most of our site's functionalities - especially purchasing and downloading games - requires having, and being logged onto, a user account. Without a user account, you will only be able to view the site - like the product pages, forums and news articles - but will effectively be unable to make any actions until you log in.

  
**How do I create a user account?**

Just click "Sign up" in the top menu bar, enter all the necessary information (double-check if necessary!) and click "Sign up now". Account creation is a very simple, one step process - we're sure you will do fine :)

  
**Am I logged in or not? And how can I logout?**

When you're logged in, you will see the "Account" button on the top menu. When you're NOT logged in, you will see the "Sign up" and "Log in" buttons instead. To log out, put your cursor on top of the "Account" button then select "Logout" from the drop-down menu.

  
**What's the best web browser for viewing GOG.COM?**

We do whatever we can to provide the best experience under Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera, just to name a few. As long as you use the latest version, you shouldn't see any real difference. And if you really want a recommendation, we'd say Firefox or Chrome.

  
**I'm having problems using GOG in my browser. What can I do?**

First, make sure you're using the latest available version of for example Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera. This excludes betas and so-called nightly builds that might have bugs.  
Secondly, please try disabling your installed addons/plugins, if any, to check if they interfere with the correct display of the website.

Lastly, if the above doesn't help, please check if the issue also occurs on a different, freshly installed browser.

If the problem persists, please contact us directly so we can investigate the issue. Please include as many details as possible about your browser, system and the problems you encountered. Screenshots are very welcome.

  
**How do I cancel my GOG account?**

We have no idea why you'd want to do that, but if you ever want to cancel your GOG user account, please contact our support team. After verifying you are the owner of the account in question and confirming that you want your account to be permanently deleted, our support will mark your account for deletion. From this moment on, the account will be inaccessible, and after 24 hours it will be irreversibly removed from our database.

Please remember that without an account, you won't be able to re-download your purchased games as well as any additional content available, including updates and patches. Also, we don't store your payment information and, if you don't want to receive newsletters from us, you can always unsubscribe in the [subscription settings](https://www.gog.com/account/settings/subscriptions) of your account.
