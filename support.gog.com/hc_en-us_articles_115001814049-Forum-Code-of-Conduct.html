        <p>First of all, welcome to our forums! We hope that you’ll find them enjoyable and you’ll have many fruitful discussions on here. Before you start posting (or if you’ve been posting for a while but feel like you need to refresh the basics), please take a moment to read through our rules of conduct, which are applicable to all forums on <a href="http://www.gog.com">www.gog.com</a>.</p>
<p>The GOG forums are safe online spaces for holding civil, lively discussion. Please do not ever post with the sole purpose and intention to upset other forum users. Negative comments and minority opinions are absolutely welcome, but forum users are expected to be able to substantiate their position without resorting to name-calling and offensive language.</p>

<li>Creating multiple accounts.</li>
<li>Posting something that is knowingly false.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thread bumping, hijacking or posting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments that are unrelated to the original topic and make it difficult for others to follow the discussion.</span></li>
<li>Posting pornography, inappropriate or offensive content, warez, unreleased game content, and things that are generally considered not suitable for work.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linking to cracks, key generators, pirated content and promoting piracy overall. However, discussions about piracy are generally acceptable.</span></li>
<li>Posting cheats, hacks, game exploits, and game spoilers - unless you clearly note that this is what your post is about at the top of it.</li>
<li>Threats of violence, harassment or privacy breach - even as a joke.</li>
<li>Using a third party’s intellectual property (full or partial scans of articles, books, full transcriptions of articles, etc.) unless you have permission to do so.</li>

<li>Encouraging anyone else to break these rules.</li>
<li>Taking any other actions that are deemed inappropriate by GOG at our sole discretion.</li>
<li>Political discussions not related to a video game are not permitted. Threads created exclusively to talk about politics will be locked. Users who ignore this rule repeatedly will be met with moderation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>HOW WE MODERATE:</h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you see a person breaking the rules, don’t attempt to moderate - let GOG Staff or GOG</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Community Moderators </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">know and ignore the post(s), threads, etc.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you should break any of the above rules, you will get a warning from one of GOG Staff or GOG </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Moderators. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you proceed to break any of the rules again, you will be banned from posting on the forum. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only exception to issuing a ban without giving a warning are situations in which drastic disrespect of the rules occurs – in such cases we will make sure to inform you of the reasons behind our decision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on the gravity of your misdemeanors,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">you might be banned for 1 week or 2 weeks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you repeatedly break forum rules despite warnings and previous bans, or if your misdemeanors are extremely serious, you may be permanently banned from posting on the forums. If your offense violates the law, your account may be suspended and relevant authorities may be notified of your misconduct.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">All decisions with regards to post moderation (edits and deleting) and user warnings are made by GOG Staff or GOG Community Moderators, whereas thread locking, temporary and permanent bans are made by GOG Staff. In both cases they are final and not up for discussion.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;However, constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, provided they are directed to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum moderators and not disputed within the forum itself.</span></li>
<li>We don’t warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any posts published on the forums.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to edit or delete any post that we feel breaks any of the rules stated within the hereby Forum Code of Conduct.</li>
<li>If you are confused about any particular action taken that involves you, please contact us.</li>
<li>Official communication with any member of GOG Staff should be considered as valid as correspondence with all moderating authorities. Abusive and/or aggressive attitude towards GOG Staff may constitute grounds for further penalties.</li>
</ul>
<p>These Forum Rules are subject to change at any time, but we will try and inform you via the forum when they do.</p>
