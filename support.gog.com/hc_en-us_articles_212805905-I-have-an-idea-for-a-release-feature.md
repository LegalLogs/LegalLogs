I have an idea for a release/feature!
=====================================

Thank you very much for thinking about us so warmly, that you came up with an idea to develop GOG into an even better service! Unfortunately we can't promise that we can implement every single good idea quickly.

  
What you can do is show us how popular yours is, with the support of other users, through our [community wishlist](https://www.gog.com/wishlist):  
If you have an idea for a cool feature or change on our website, [let us know here](https://www.gog.com/wishlist/site).  
If you want us to release your favorite game, [here's the place to vote for it](https://www.gog.com/wishlist/games).  
If you want us to change something in the GOG GALAXY application, [here's the place](https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy).

  
Please remember to use the search function first, as someone might have had a similar idea before. Also, one wish with many votes is much more impressive to outsiders than five wishes with slightly different titles.
