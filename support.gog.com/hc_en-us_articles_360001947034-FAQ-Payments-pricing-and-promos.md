FAQ: Payments, pricing and promos
=================================

**What payment methods do you accept?**

All our prices are in USD, and - where applicable - in AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CNY, DKK, EUR, GBP, NOK, PLN, RUB, and SEK as well. You can freely switch from your local currency to USD, and (in some European countries) EUR, if you prefer.

To switch your currency setting, look for a drop-down menu on the bottom-right of the site, or in your account's settings.

  
  
**What is Paysafecard?**

Paysafecard is a prepaid online payment method which is distributed in physical form, either as a paper voucher or a card. It contains a unique 16-digit code. Basically, it allows you to make a purchase on the Internet if you do not have a credit card or a PayPal account. All you need to do is to buy your paysafecard in one of thousands of physical locations, and then use the code to purchase something on our website.

  
  
**I've received a payment processing error. What now?**

If you've received a payment processing error don't worry, you won't be billed. You can try entering your payment details again by clicking the “Retry payment” button. Just please double-check your security code and card expiration date before clicking “Process my order now”.

If the problem happens again, contact our Support team via the "My orders and payments" contact form. Please include as much information as possible, including steps that you've taken so far and any errors received, but DO NOT include your card number or security code!

  
  
**What are bonus and gift codes? How do I redeem them?**

Bonus codes are special "coupons" that can be exchanged for either one, or many free items - depending on the code. They are typically provided via contests or promotional emails, so stay tuned, visit GOG often and maybe you'll score a code or two ;).

Gift codes are codes that have been purchased by somebody on GOG and contain one or multiple games. These codes can be given to other people for them to add the game(s) to their own accounts.

To redeem a bonus code, go [here](https://www.gog.com/redeem). You can also redeem gift codes in this section of the site.

  
  
**My bonus code doesn't work. Help!**

First, please double-check if you've entered the bonus code correctly – try to copy and paste it directly into the browser. Also, most codes can be redeemed only once and only for a given time before they expire. If the code has been redeemed earlier or it has expired, you will receive an appropriate error message. Last but not least, keep in mind that once the code has been used, you cannot “reactivate” it, even if you cancel the order in question.

Still, if you have no idea why you cannot redeem your code, contact our Support team via the "My orders and payments" contact form. Please include as much information as possible, including the code that you're trying to redeem, where you got the code from and the contents of the error message.
