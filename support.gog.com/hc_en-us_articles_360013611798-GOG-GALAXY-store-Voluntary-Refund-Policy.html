<li><strong>What is the Voluntary Refund Policy of the new store inside GOG GALAXY?</strong><br>The updated policy lets you refund a product up to 30 days after purchase, even if it was downloaded, launched, and played. Yes, you read that correctly. :) To apply for a refund, you should <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=orders">contact our Customer Support Team</a> within 30 days of your purchase, and our team will sort it out as soon as possible.<br>However, if the reason you are seeking a refund is that your game is not working (yet!), please consider <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=technical">contacting our friendly Tech Support folk</a> first. They will do their best to help you get the game working on your machine.<br>We're monitoring the effects of this policy to make sure no one is using this policy to hurt the developers that put their time and heart into making great games. We may refuse refunds in such individual cases. We'd also let you know about any future adjustments in the Voluntary Refund Policy in advance.</li>
<li><strong>How long does it take to process a refund?</strong><br>At this time, only cash refunds are possible in the new store.<br>Cash refunds can take a few business days, depending on the exact payment method used, your bank, etc. There are some exceptions, such as paysafecard, SOFORT, and GiroPay - for technical reasons, these transactions need to be fully processed before they can be refunded; this can take up to a few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>What about pre-orders?</strong><br>Pre-orders can be refunded throughout their pre-order period (as in - until they get released), and for 30 days after their release date.</li>
<li><strong>What about game packs and DLCs?</strong><br>For technical reasons, we cannot divide a game pack (for instance, a season pass, a pack containing the base game and its DLCs, or a pack containing a whole series of games). As a result, you would get a refund for the full pack and, as a consequence, the full pack will be removed from your account.<br>If you apply for a refund for a DLC, and it was not purchased as a pack (bundled with the base game), we can issue a refund for the DLC itself.<br>If you refund the base game, but also purchased DLCs separately, we would also refund the DLCs linked to that base game.</li>
<li><strong>How often can I refund my games? Is there some sort of limit?</strong><br>We trust that you're making informed purchasing decisions and will use this updated voluntary Refund Policy only if something doesn't work as you expected.<br>This is why there are no limits but instead, we reserve the right to refuse refunds in individual cases.<br>Please respect all the time and hard work put into making the games you play and remember that refunds are not reviews. If you finished the game and didn't like it, please consider sharing your opinion instead. Also, please don't take advantage of our trust by asking for an unreasonable amount of games to be refunded. Don't be that person. No one likes that person.</li>
<li><strong>What if my country provides additional rights?</strong><br>Just let us know. We respect regional laws, to learn more see sections 7.1. and 7.2. of the <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG User Agreement</a>.</li>
