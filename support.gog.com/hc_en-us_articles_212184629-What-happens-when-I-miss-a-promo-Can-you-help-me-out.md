What happens when I miss a promo? Can you help me out?
======================================================

Our current deals with publishers usually only allow us to release games for certain prices, and we are unable to extend the promo once it ended, grant an individual discount, give away the games for free, or price-match offers on other services.  
Unfortunately, you have to wait for the next promo - donâ€™t worry though, we have plenty of them. :)
