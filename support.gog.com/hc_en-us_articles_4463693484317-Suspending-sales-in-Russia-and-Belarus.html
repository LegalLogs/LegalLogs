          Suspending sales in Russia and Belarus

        <p>In light of the Russian military invasion on our neighboring country of Ukraine, until further notice, we made the decision to halt all sales in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Effective March 3rd, 2022, we suspend sales of all games distributed on GOG platform on the territories of Russia and Belarus. While buying products on GOG is not possible, users from the affected territories can still log in to their accounts and keep access to purchased items.</p>
<p>The entire CD PROJEKT Group stand firm with the people of Ukraine. While we are not a political entity capable of directly influencing state matters and donâ€™t aspire to be one, we do believe that commercial entities, when united, have the power to inspire global change in the hearts and minds of ordinary people. With this action, we wish to further galvanize the global community to speak about what is going on in the heart of Europe.</p>
<p>While the situation develops further, we will be sure to keep you informed should any of the above change. </p>
