          Can I add to my GOG account some games that I bought elsewhere?

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, only The Witcher games purchased outside of GOG can be redeemed on our website via the </span><a href="https://www.gog.com/witcher/backup"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witcher backup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please follow the link above to learn more about which games you can reclaim, and how.</span></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game you redeem here is subject to the EULA provided with the GOG version of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a similar campaign is made available elsewhere, your key won't be redeemable again.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is every game code redeemable here?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only selected game keys for </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Witcher</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Witcher 2</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are redeemable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free backup of The Witcher games on GOG is available to gamers who bought either of these games for PC or Mac at any other store in the world. If you bought The Witcher or The Witcher 2 from GOG, of course, you already have a DRM-free copy you can download whenever you want--right on your shelf! For Steam, the offer is only available for codes redeemed on Steam till 2022/03/16.</span></p>
<p><strong>My key doesn't work!</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your key doesn't work, double-check that you wrote down the key exactly as it is written and that you didn't mix up your 0 and O.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will you include more titles in the future?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're doing our best to add more games. Stay tuned for future updates and announcements as soon as we know more.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can I get a refund for the game I reclaimed?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We're treating this as we would any normal giveaway, we can only offer refunds for games you paid for. If you encounter any issues with your game, get in touch with our customer support and we'll do our best to get them resolved.</span></p>
<p><strong>Will I receive just what was in my game box, or the entire corresponding product from the GOG catalogue?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will get the exact same game thatâ€™s available for purchase on GOG. That includes every available bonus goodie and all future updates.</span></p>
<p><strong>My game version is listed and I'm doing everything right. Why can't I reclaim my game?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We've done our best to acquire the most complete, up-to-date key databases of retail versions for the eligible titles, and we have nearly everything covered. Still, sometimes data can go missing, backups can be outdated, and (since we're dealing with pretty old databases here) plenty of things can simply go wrong. If your game key should be eligible but doesn't work, please consider contacting our Support Team.</span></p>
