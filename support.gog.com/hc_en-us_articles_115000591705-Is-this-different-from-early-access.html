          Is this different from early access?
        </h1>

      <div class="article__body markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Early access means the opportunity to try games early and participate in community-driven development, as well as the chance to support a game's production.</p>
<p>Our take on games in development is all of those things, with the additional benefits of the GOG way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> — When choosing the games that are a good fit for GOG, we make sure to pick the ones we can truly stand behind.</li>
<li><strong> 30-day refund policy</strong> — You can download, play, and refund any game in development within 30 days of purchase - no questions asked.</li>
<li><strong> Rollback in GOG GALAXY</strong> — Keep playing your game if the newest update is not doing it for you, or revisit historical version snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>The games are DRM-free</strong> — No annoyances, no online checks.</li>
</ul>
