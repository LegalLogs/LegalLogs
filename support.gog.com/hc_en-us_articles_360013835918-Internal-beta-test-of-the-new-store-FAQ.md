### **General questions**

**What is the new store in GOG GALAXY?**

We created GOG GALAXY to give gamers a better way of organizing all their games across multiple gaming platforms into one library. Similarly, in the new store, we will be welcoming games from both GOG and beyond - including titles previously exclusive only to other gaming platforms.

**What about GOG.COM store?**

GOG.COM remains a DRM-free store. We are committed to bringing you more exceptional AAAs, great indies and all-time classics free of any DRM or mandatory applications. As always the choice is yours - you can stick to the GOG.COM store or give the GOG GALAXY store a spin.

**What games are available in the current test phase?**

As part of the test, invited users will be able to buy games from a selection of hand-picked Epic Games Store exclusive titles, as well as all of the games available on GOG.COM.

**Does it mean games with DRM will be sold in the new store in GOG GALAXY?**

GOG GALAXY was created as the app to organize all your games across multiple gaming platforms - no matter if these were DRM-free single player games or online-only MMOs. Similarly, the new store in GOG GALAXY welcomes all games from all platforms - including those from GOG.

**Why should I consider buying games from the new store in GOG GALAXY?**

By design, the new store in GOG GALAXY will offer a much bigger selection of games. All purchases are covered by our 30-day refund policy and 24/7 human support. On top of that we believe buying games in the new store will be a convenient way to expand your cross-platform library inside the application.

**What happens if I buy a game in the new store in GOG GALAXY?**

Once you purchase a game, it becomes available to install and launch both from GOG GALAXY as well as the partner’s platform app. So if you buy a GOG game, a DRM-free copy will be added to your GOG account. Similarly, by buying a game from Epic Games Store, you will activate the game on your Epic Games account.

**How can I participate in this test of the new store in GOG GALAXY?**

Access to the internal beta test is invitation-only. We're inviting a select group of GOG users. If you have an active GOG account, you may be invited and receive the welcome email in your inbox.

**How long will the test phase last / when will the new store be available for everyone?**

We've put a lot of effort into building the new store, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us. We’ve launched a test, by invitation only, to listen and gather feedback on how we can make it better. Based on the feedback, we will work on improving the store, and will launch it for everyone once it’s ready.

**I don't want to use the new store in GOG GALAXY. What can I do?**

If you prefer using the GOG.COM store, you can switch back to it in the GOG GALAXY’s app settings.

**Do I need an Epic account to buy games in the new store inside GOG GALAXY?**

If you’re buying a game from Epic Games Store, you need an account on that platform. You will be asked to sign in or register to your account during the checkout process.

**Where should I share my feedback on the new store?**

Please share any feedback in the form we’ve created specifically for this purpose. You can find the link to the form in the invitation email you have received from us or on the banner on the main page of the new store inside GOG GALAXY.

**Can I publicly share screenshots or videos of the new store?**

We kindly ask you not to share screenshots or videos of the store. The current version of the store is still a work in progress and doesn’t represent the final quality we are aiming for. There are important features we still need to tackle – for example, there’s no shopping cart or user reviews available. Thanks for respecting this request.

  
  

### **Technical questions**

**How do I access the new store?**

If you have received the invitation for the internal beta test, please navigate to the "Deals" section on the left sidebar in the application and click "Store", and you should see the new store.

If you still have no access to the new store:

*   make sure you have the latest version of the GOG GALAXY app. You can download the latest installer from [https://www.gogalaxy.com/](https://www.gogalaxy.com/)
*   click on the cog icon (top-left), go to Settings and in the "Interface" section change the "Preferred store" to "GOG GALAXY store".

  
  

### **Purchases**

**How do I buy a game?**

It’s super easy! Simply select the game from the catalog, click on “Buy now" and fill in your payment details to complete the order. For the game that originates from a different platform than GOG, you will need to log into your account on that platform; if you don’t have that account, you will be able to create it during the purchase process. That’s it!

Once your payment is processed, the game will be added to your GOG GALAXY games library, as well as to the account on the respective platform.

**Can I buy the game as a gift?**

Currently, games available in the new GOG GALAXY store cannot be purchased as gifts.

**What currencies and payment methods do you accept?**

At this moment the new store inside GOG GALAXY supports payments with credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex and JCB) and PayPal.  
The currencies that we support are AUD, BRL, CAD, CHF, CNY, DKK, EUR, GBP, NOK, PLN, RUB and SEK -- which are available in supported countries, based on your IP address -- and also USD, which is available everywhere.

**I purchased the game and I cannot find it**

A game purchased in the new store inside GOG GALAXY will be available in your GOG GALAXY library, as well as in the library of the platform from which the game comes from.

If our app doesn’t detect your game, please click on the settings icon in the upper-left corner of the screen and select "Sync integrations".

**I got charged and I didn’t get my game**

If it looks like you did get charged, but didn't get your game, or if you got charged multiple times, please [contact us](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=orders) immediately. Please keep in mind, though, that some payment methods can take a long time to fully process.

Keep in mind, though, that banks normally "block" funds prior to a transaction, so it's easy to mistake blocked funds for actually charged ones. Make sure to double-check if you were indeed charged.

On rare occasions, it can take up to two hours for orders to be fully processed, so if your game hasn't appeared in your library in that timeframe, despite your payment being successful, please [contact us](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=orders) directly so that we can sort the issue out.

**I tried to make a payment and it didn't work. What can I do now?**

While we do our best to make our payment systems bulletproof, there are circumstances beyond our control that could prevent a payment from going through.

Unless you confirmed that money was taken from your account already, you should try paying again. Perhaps you made a typo when typing in your card number?

If you are sure that your payment information was correct, it's possible that your bank did not authorize the transaction for some reason. Keep in mind that we are based in Europe, and your card must support online transactions internationally (for instance, many American prepaid cards do not support them).

It may be necessary for you to contact your bank for assistance, because - most of the time - payment issues are beyond our control. If your bank says that everything is OK on their end, or that they don't see any payment attempts from us ("GOG.COM" or "GOG Ltd"), you should definitely [contact us](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=orders) using the support form.

Most importantly - if it looks like you did get charged, but didn't get your game, [contact us](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new?form=orders) immediately.

Keep in mind, though, that banks normally "block" funds prior to a transaction, so it's easy to mistake blocked funds for actually charged ones. Make sure to double-check if you were indeed charged.

  
  

### **Games - technical questions**

**How do I install a game purchased in the new store inside GOG GALAXY?**

It’s just as easy as getting it. Simply select the game from your GOG GALAXY library, click on the purple “Install" button, and follow the instructions. Keep in mind that games from other platforms will be installed using the respective platform’s app; please also note that you will only be able to install a game if your operating system is supported by it.

**My game doesn’t work, can you help?**

If you’re experiencing any technical issues with the game purchased in the new store inside GOG GALAXY, regardless of the platform from which it comes from, please consult the support articles available [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/categories/201400969), and contact our technical support if needed - we’ll do what we can to make the game working.
