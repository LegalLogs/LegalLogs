<p><span lang="en-US"><strong>HOW TO USE GOG’S NEW AFFILIATES PROGRAM</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="en-US">You can create tracking links in the </span><a href="http://GOG.COM">GOG.COM</a>&nbsp;section of your AdTraction dashboard<span lang="en-US"> (<a href="https://secure.adtraction.com/affiliate/program.htm?apid=1578845455">https://secure.adtraction.com/affiliate/program.htm?apid=1578845455</a>)</span></li>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="fr-FR">Links never expire.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="en-US">You can also create short links. Just click on the dedicated option.</span><span lang="en-US"></span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you don’t want to create AdTraction links manually, you can use their ‘Clean Links’ Script on all your pages, so all GOG links are automatically transformed into affiliates links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also create GOG-branded links! Get your Channel ID from AdTraction and create links as such:&nbsp;<a href="https://af.gog.com/game/diablo?as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here">https://af.gog.com/game/diablo?as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here</a>. As you can notice, you have to replace ‘www’ with ‘af’. You also have to add your channel ID to your URL, via a ‘as’ parameter. You can chain parameters; for example:&nbsp;<a href="https://af.gog.com/games?sort=popularity&amp;category=role-playing&amp;price=discounted&amp;as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here">https://af.gog.com/games?sort=popularity&amp;category=role-playing&amp;price=discounted&amp;as=your_adtraction_channel_id_here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
