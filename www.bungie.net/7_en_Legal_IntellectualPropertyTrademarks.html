of our community to produce non-commercial content using video images, footage,
music, sounds, dialogue, or other assets from our games, subject to a few
conditions. These creations can be freely shared with other players in places
like the Bungie.net <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations">creations</a> page or your own personal channels. Bungie also generally
approves streaming or commentary through approved platforms like Twitch,
YouTube, or Facebook.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bungie reserves the right to enforce
its intellectual property rights against any infringer who violates the
following guidelines or community standards. In the event that creators seek to
profit from the use of Bungie assets, they must seek permission from Bungie and
obtain a license to do so. If you are an individual or company that is
interested in an official merchandise license agreement, please contact us by
sending an email inquiry to <a href="mailto:licensing@bungie.com">licensing@bungie.com</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><h3><font color="#f2c261">Media</font></h3><div>Players may create videos using
Destiny gameplay, which may be uploaded to third party sharing services like
YouTube. If a chosen video-on-demand service enables players to monetize
content, we will generally not request takedown if at least 20% of the content
within the video has been created by the player. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Examples of what “player created
content” may be defined as include custom commentary, animations, graphics, or
gameplay. Conversely, please do not upload Bungie trailers or cutscenes with mere
advertisement(s) or borders that take up 20% of the screen or 20% of the
runtime. Content creators should use our stuff to make their own stuff, rather
than uploading our content to their own channels.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Streaming gameplay is another viable
form of sharing community-created Destiny content. Services like Twitch enable
players to monetize content via subscriptions or donations. For additional
information, please refer to the terms of use for your preferred streaming
platform.<br></div><div><br></div><hr><h3><font color="#f2c261">"Destiny" Labeling</font></h3><div>Subject to the guidelines below,
players and content creators may create and share a variety of non-commercial
content. If you are monetizing creations that are not derived from any
characters, images, footage, or other Bungie IP assets, please do not label
your creations with the names of any Bungie products (e.g. Destiny, Destiny 2)
or the names of in-game assets. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bungie is obligated to enforce
against both intentional infringement and inadvertent dilution of its
trademarks. We do not enjoy issuing takedown notices, but we must do so in
cases where infringement could threaten our ability to protect our brands.&nbsp;<br></div><div><hr></div><h3><font color="#f2c261">Art</font></h3><div>Derivative artworks (physical and
digital) based on the world of Destiny cannot be sold without expressed
permission from Bungie.&nbsp;Bungie reserves the rights to all character
models, armor and weapon models (3D and physical), in-game and cutscene
scenery, characters, dialogue, and music. Artwork, clothing, or models depicting
any such Destiny IP will be removed if it is commercialized without permission,
or if it violates our community standards.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Bungie opposes the creation and sale
of 1:1 weapon replicas based on our game assets and will take action to have
listings of this kind removed regardless of whether they have been
commercialized.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Art may be uploaded to the
Bungie.net Community&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Community/Creations">Creations&nbsp;</a>page, or other social networks or community websites such as
Twitter, Facebook, or Deviant Art. Your artwork may also be submitted as a
Merchandise Inquiry. If you have already signed an agreement with Bungie to
commercialize your art, sales through unauthorized channels can still be
subject to removal. To inquire about obtaining a license to create and sell Destiny-inspired
art, or to inquire about the terms of an existing license, contact us by
sending an email inquiry to <a href="mailto:licensing@bungie.com">licensing@bungie.com</a>.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><h3><font color="#f2c261">Cosplay</font></h3><div>Costumes and Props are often swapped
or traded between Cosplayers in the interest of recuperating expenses for
fabrication. While this act of community sharing is permitted, the distribution
of any physical items using online platforms including (but not limited to)
Etsy, ebay, or Amazon is not authorized without expressed permission. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
There are many reasons for this
policy. Not only do we want uniformity in how we address infringing content, we
also cannot guarantee the quality, safety, or origin of merchandise sold online
without a working relationship with the vendor. We are committed to ensuring
that Destiny IP does not find its way into any products produced using child
labor, dangerous materials, or dangerous construction. To inquire about
obtaining a license to create and sell these items, contact us by sending an
email inquiry to <a href="mailto:licensing@bungie.com">licensing@bungie.com</a>.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><h3><font color="#f2c261">Merchandise</font></h3><div>The Bungie Store features official
products that enable players to express their enthusiasm for Destiny. Specific
licensed partners also offer products available to players of Destiny. To
ensure the quality of all Destiny products, all merchandise is created under a
licensing agreement and all prospective licensees are thoroughly reviewed by Bungie
before a license is granted. If you are an individual or company that is
interested in an official merchandise license agreement, please contact us by
sending an email inquiry to <a href="mailto:licensing@bungie.com">licensing@bungie.com</a>.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><hr></div><h3><font color="#f2c261">Legal</font></h3><div>For more information, please refer
