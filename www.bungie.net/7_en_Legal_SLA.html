States or users of the Program in the United States, allowed either party to

<p>LIMITED USE LICENSE: Bungie
grants you the non-exclusive, personal, non-transferable, limited right and
license to install and use one copy of this Program solely for your
non-commercial use. All rights not specifically granted are reserved by Bungie.
The Program is licensed, not sold, for your use. Your license confers no title
or ownership in this Program and should not be construed as a sale of any
rights in this Program. This Agreement shall also apply to patches or updates

additional terms as provided in the section regarding “Changes to the
Agreement” below.</p>

<p>LICENSE CONDITIONS: This
license is subject to the following limitations ("License
Limitations"). Any use of the Program in violation of the License

reproduce, distribute, display or use any part of this Program except as

RESULT IN A SUSPENSION OR BAN, IN ADDITION TO ALL OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO

<p>LIVE AND TIME-LIMITED GAME
ELEMENTS: Your use of the Program involves interaction with Bungie’s live game
environment. The Program and its live game environment change over time. Bungie
does not guarantee that you will be able to participate in all events or earn all
in-game achievements. Access to some Live Content may require additional
purchase. Some in-game elements, including without limitation, Live Content
associated with season passes, are made available to players for a limited
time. Where season pass Live Content is time-limited, Bungie will use
reasonable efforts to communicate this to you within the Program or otherwise.
Bungie may extend the time-limit for Live Content, including season passes, at
its option with or without advance notice. Fees charged for time-limited
content are based on access to the applicable content during the time period
indicated at the time of purchase, and apply whether or not you actually access
the content. Season pass rewards earned during a given season must be redeemed
during that season, unless Bungie elects to provide a grace period for
redemption at its sole discretion.</p>

<p>OWNERSHIP: All title, ownership
rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any copies
thereof are owned by Bungie. This Program is protected by the copyright laws of
the United States, international copyright treaties, and conventions and other
laws. This Program contains certain licensed materials, and Bungie’s licensors
may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.</p>

<p>PATCHES AND UPDATES: Bungie may
deploy or provide patches, updates, and modifications to the Program that must
be installed for you to continue to use the Program. Bungie may update the
Program remotely without notifying you, and you hereby grant to Bungie consent
to deploy and apply such patches, updates, and modifications.</p>

<p>LIMITED WARRANTY: Bungie
warrants to the original consumer purchaser of this Program that the physical
media on which this Program is stored, and any physical accessories, (together
the “Goods”) will be free from defects in material and workmanship for 90 days
from the date of purchase. If the Goods are found defective within 90 days of
original purchase, Bungie agrees to replace, free of charge, any such defective
Goods within such period, upon its receipt of the Program (postage paid, with
proof of the date of purchase) so long as the Goods are still being
manufactured by Bungie. If the Goods are no longer available, Bungie retains
the right to substitute similar goods of equal or greater value. This warranty
is limited to the Goods, as originally provided by Bungie, and is not
applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable, and
shall be void, if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or
neglect. Any implied warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to
the 90-day period described above. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH HEREIN, THIS WARRANTY IS
IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>

<p>For customers in EU and other
countries: This warranty is provided without prejudice to your statutory rights
as a consumer which will always prevail. Bungie will only be responsible for
any loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of the breach of
this Agreement by Bungie or its negligence. Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit or exclude our liability for death or personal injury resulting from
negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation; or any other liability that cannot be
excluded or limited by English law. This section shall prevail over all other
parts of this Agreement.</p>

<p>LIMITATION ON DAMAGES: IN NO
EVENT WILL BUNGIE BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE, OR MALFUNCTION OF THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING
DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION AND, TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF BUNGIE HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BUNGIE’S LIABILITY SHALL NOT
EXCEED THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID FOR THE LICENSE TO USE THIS PROGRAM. SOME
STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS
AND/OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND/OR
EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS,
AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>

<p>TERMINATION: Without prejudice
to any other rights of Bungie, this Agreement will terminate automatically if
you fail to comply with its terms and conditions. In such event, you must
destroy all copies of this Program and all of its component parts. You may also
terminate the Agreement at any time by permanently deleting any installation of
the Program, and destroying all copies of the Program in your possession or
control. Bungie may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no
reason. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Program and all of
its component parts. The License Limitations, limitation on damages, limited
warranty, indemnity, and miscellaneous provisions shall survive termination of
this Agreement.</p>

<p>INJUNCTION: Because Bungie
would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not
specifically enforced, you agree that Bungie shall be entitled, without bond,
other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with
respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as
Bungie may otherwise have under applicable laws.</p>

<p>INDEMNITY: You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold Bungie, its partners, affiliates, licensors,
contractors, officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from all
damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your breach of
this Agreement and/or your acts and omissions in using the Program pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement.</p>

<p>CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT:
Except for the sections regarding “CLASS ACTION WAIVER” below, Bungie reserves
the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add to, supplement or
delete any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any time and by
any means, including, without limitation, (1) by posting the modifications
to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Legal/sla">https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Le...</a>; and/or (2) by requiring you to “click
to accept” when Bungie upgrades or patches the Program, and your continued use
of the Program constitutes your acceptance of the modifications. The changes to
the Agreement will be effective upon prior notice as follows: Bungie will post
the revised version of this Agreement on its website, may include the terms
with a patch or update and require acceptance as part of the installation
process, or may provide such other notice as Bungie may elect at its sole
discretion. If any future changes to this Agreement are unacceptable to you or
cause you to no longer be in compliance with this Agreement, you may terminate
this Agreement and receive a refund in accordance with this Agreement. Your
installation and use of any of Bungie’s updates, patches or modifications to
the Program or your continued use of the Program following notice of changes to
this Agreement will demonstrate your acceptance of any and all such changes. If
any future modifications are implemented as a “click to accept” agreement, you
may not be able to continue using the Program unless you affirmatively accept
the modified Agreement.</p>

<p>LIVE CONTENT: “Live
Content" consists of content provided to Program users (e.g., unlockable
content, gear, live events, activities, destinations, accounts, stats, virtual
assets, virtual currencies, codes, and achievements) in connection with use of
the Program. While the Program may allow you to “earn”, "buy", or
"purchase" Live Content within or in connection with gameplay, you do
not in fact own or have any property interest in the Live Content. Unless
otherwise specified in writing, any Live Content that you receive is licensed
to you as set forth herein, and you shall have no ownership right thereto.
Unless specifically permitted by Bungie, you may not, sell, lend, rent, trade,
or otherwise transfer any Live Content. Live Content may be altered, removed,
deleted, or discontinued by Bungie at any time (e.g., upon termination of this
Agreement and/or cessation of online support for the Program), even if you have
not “used” or “consumed” the Live Content prior to alteration, removal,
deletion, or discontinuation. Some Live Content, including without limitation,
activities, maps, and gear, may be made available to players for only a limited
time. Live Content has no monetary value and does not constitute property of
any type.</p>

<p>Without limiting the above,
Live Content may include virtual coins, points or other virtual currencies
(“Virtual Currency”). By purchasing or otherwise acquiring Virtual Currency,
you obtain a limited license (which is revocable by Bungie at any time unless
otherwise required by applicable laws) to access and select from other Live
Content. Virtual Currency has no monetary value and does not constitute
currency or property of any type. Virtual Currency may be redeemed for other
Live Content only, if at all. Virtual Currency cannot be sold or transferred,
and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services, except
for other Live Content, where applicable. Subject to applicable local law,
Virtual Currency is non-refundable. You are not entitled to a refund or any
other compensation such as Live Content for any unused Virtual Currency and
unused Virtual Currency is non-exchangeable.</p>

<p>There may be Live Content
(should you choose to purchase it) which will require you to make a payment
with real money, the amount of which will be set out in the Program. Live
Content purchases are non-refundable, and you acknowledge that this is the case
and that you will have no right to change your mind and cancel (sometimes known
as a 'cooling off' right) once your purchase is complete. Depending on your
platform, any Live Content purchased, may be purchased from your platform
provider and such purchase will be subject to your platform provider’s Terms of
Service and User Agreement. Please check usage rights for each purchase as
these may differ from item to item. Unless otherwise shown, content available
in any game store has the same age rating as the game.</p>

<p>For SIEA users: When accessing
the Program on a Sony PlayStation® product, purchase and use of items are
subject to Sony’s Network Terms of Service and User Agreement. This online
service has been sublicensed to you by Sony Interactive Entertainment America.</p>

<p>For SIEE users: When accessing
the Program on a Sony PlayStation® product, any content purchased in an in-game

<p>AVAILABILITY:</p>

<p>For residents in North America:
Bungie does not guarantee that any online services, play or features associated
with the Program (collectively, “Online Services”) or Live Content will be
available at all times or at any given time or that Bungie will continue to
offer Online Services or Live Content for any particular length of time. Bungie

Bungie makes no warranty or representation regarding the availability of Online
Services and reserves the right to modify or discontinue Online Services at its
sole discretion without notice, including for example, ceasing an Online

make use of the Online Service over time. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ONLINE SERVICES MAY BE TERMINATED IN
WHOLE OR IN PART AT BUNGIE’S SOLE DISCRETION WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. IN
CONNECTION WITH ONLINE SERVICES’ TERMINATION, YOUR ABILITY TO ACCESS, USE AND

CONTENT LICENSED TO YOU MAY BE TERMINATED. YOU ASSUME ANY AND ALL RISK OF LOSS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERMINATION OF ONLINE SERVICES AND ANY LOSS OF LIVE CONTENT
OR OTHERWISE.</p>

<p>For residents outside North
America: Subject to the next sentence, Bungie does not guarantee that any
Online Services or Live Content will be available or error-free at all times or
at any given time. Bungie warrants that the Program, in addition to any Live
Content which has been paid-for with real money, will substantially comply with
the description provided by it at the point of purchase and be of satisfactory
quality (in addition any related services provided through them will be
provided with reasonable care and skill). Bungie may change and update Online
Services or Live Content without notice to you (provided always that any such
changes do not result in material degradation in the functionality of the
Program or any Live Content which has been paid-for with real money). Bungie
makes no warranty or representation regarding the availability of Online
Services and/or Live Content which are free (i.e., not paid-for with real
money) and each reserve the right to modify or discontinue them at its sole
discretion without notice to you, including for example, for economic reasons
due to a limited number of users continuing to make use of them over time.
Bungie is not liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in
performance of, any of its obligations that is caused by events outside its
reasonable control. If such circumstances result in material degradation in the
functionality of the Program or Live Content then your obligation to make any
payment to download, use or access them will be suspended for the duration of
such period. Bungie is entitled to modify or discontinue Online Services and/or
Live Content which are paid-for with real money at its sole discretion upon
reasonable notice to you. The warranty for such Online Services and/or Live
Content is provided in accordance with your statutory rights as a consumer
which will always prevail.</p>

<p>For residents in North
America-- CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</p>

<p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT
MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A
LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>

<p><u>The Agreement prior to August
17, 2021 included a BINDING ARBITRATION clause that, for residents of the
United States or users of the Program in the United States, allowed either
party to the Agreement to initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to
resolve claims arising out of the Agreement, subject to JAMS. “Arising out of
the Agreement” means, specifically, claims relating to the interpretation,
formation, performance, or breach of the Agreement, the parties’ relationship
with each other, and/or your use of the Program. The following provisions of
the Agreement are in effect as of August 17, 2021, except that additional terms
related to BINDING ARBITRATION remain in effect until October 16, 2021. The
additional terms include a 30-day opt-out right relating to BINDING
ARBITRATION, which you can review in the prior version of the Agreement </u><strong><a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt9597f6b19732f1a1/611447c95780ae139064381e/SLA_Bungie.net.pdf">at this link</a>. </strong></p>

<p>These CLASS ACTION WAIVER
provisions apply to you if you are domiciled in and/or acquired and use the
Program in the United States. These provisions may also apply to you if you are
domiciled in and/or acquired and use the Program from outside the United
States. See JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW below for details.</p>

<p>Class Action Waiver: The
parties agree that any claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement
(including its interpretation, formation, performance and breach), the parties'
relationship with each other and/or your use of the Program shall be finally
settled by litigation conducted in their individual capacities only and not as
a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive
their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU, ON THE
ONE HAND, AND BUNGIE, ON THE OTHER HAND, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

<p>Exception - Litigation of
Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Either party may bring an
action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent
infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark
infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation. Either party may also seek
relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that
court's jurisdiction.</p>

<p>30 Day Right to Opt Out: You
have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the class action waiver
provisions set forth in the "Class Action Waiver" paragraphs above by
sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address:
Bungie, Inc., 550 106th Ave NE #207, Bellevue, Washington 98004, Attn: Legal.
The notice must be sent within 30 days of purchasing the Program (or if no
purchase was made, then within 30 days of the date on which you first access or
use the Program and agree to these terms). If you opt-out of these provisions,
Bungie also will not be bound by them.</p>

<p>Changes to this Section: Bungie
will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to these sections regarding “CLASS
ACTION WAIVER.” Changes will become effective on the 60th day and will apply
prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>

<p>MISCELLANEOUS: This Agreement
is the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and
supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. If any
provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable
and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected. To the
extent permitted by applicable law: (i) this Agreement shall be construed under
Washington law as such law is applied to agreements between Washington
residents entered into and to be performed within Washington, except as
governed by federal law, and (ii) you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the state and federal courts in King County, Washington.</p>
