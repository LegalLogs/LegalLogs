<p>o    <strong>Cookies</strong>. A “cookie” is a text file that is placed on your device by a web server that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Bungie Services. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. For further information on cookies, please review our <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/legal/cookiepolicy"><u><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></u></a>. </p>
<p>o    <strong>Pixels</strong> (also known as web beacons). Web pages and other content (such as videos, emails, and advertisements) may contain pieces of code that send information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or another entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a particular device. We may incorporate pixels that allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Bungie Services, and provide you with additional functionality. </p>
<p>o    <strong>App Technologies</strong>. We include technologies in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server. These SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, and provide you with additional functionality. </p>
<p>o    <strong>Heat Maps.</strong> Through the use of pixels, we generate various types of heat maps, including but not limited to scroll maps, click maps, and move maps, to help us determine the most popular and unpopular areas of the Bungie Services and to help us better understand how users interact with the Bungie Services.</p>

<p>o    <strong>Bungie Services Use Data</strong>, including information about your use of the Bungie Services, the pages and content that you view, the referring and exiting pages, your access times, the links you click, and other actions taken within the Bungie Services. </p>

Other Services.</strong><br><br>We offer parts of the Bungie Services through websites, platforms, and services operated or controlled by separate entities. In addition, we integrate links and technologies operated or controlled by separate entities into parts of the Bungie Services. Please note that when you interact with other entities, including when you leave the Bungie Services, those entities may independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere.

Analytics and Advertising.</strong><br><br>We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how users access and use the Bungie Services. In addition, we work with agencies, advertisers, ad networks, and other ad partners to place ads for our products and services on other websites and services. For example, we place ads through Google, Facebook, Snap, Twitter, Verizon Media, Reddit, and Amazon that you may view on their platforms as well as, in certain circumstances, on other websites and services. <br><br>As part of this process, we incorporate tracking technologies from us and our vendors and ad partners into the Bungie Services (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. These tracking technologies collect data across time and services for purposes of measuring conversions or actions you take, associating the various devices you use, and serving ads and/or other content targeted to your interests (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”). For instance, we incorporate pixels from Facebook, Snap, Google, Twitter, Verizon Media, Reddit, and Amazon on the Bungie Services, and may share your information with them for these purposes. <br><br>We also use audience matching services (which is a type of Interest-based Advertising) to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited the Bungie Services or are identified in one or more of our databases (“<strong>Matched Ads</strong>”). This is done by us sharing a list of hashed emails with an ad partner or incorporating a pixel from an ad partner into the Bungie Services that collects device identifiers and browser-related information, and the ad partner matching common factors between our data and their data. Some of the ad partners we use for Matched Ads include Facebook, Google, Snap, Verizon Media, Twitter, and Amazon.   <br><br>As indicated above, vendors and ad partners may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information.

Opting out only means that the selected participants should no longer deliver certain targeted ads to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., in connection with the participants’ other customers or from other technology services). Some of these ad partners may also offer their own tools, and you should visit their websites to learn more.<br><br>To opt out of us sharing your hashed email for Matched Ads, please contact us as set out in the “Contact Us” section below and specify that you wish to opt out of Matched Ads.
