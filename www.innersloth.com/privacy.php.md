Privacy Policy
==============

Below is our Privacy Policy. It is long, but worth the read as it explains how we use your personal information. At a high-level, we wanted to explain what personal information we process for Among Us and our website.

**Among Us:**

*   You cannot play online without a guest account or a full account.
*   Any type of account creates and stores an account ID for you that we use for moderation and account linking.
*   If you create a guest account, we will use your username, IP address, and gameplay information, so you can play the game. We do not store these after your game ends unless you are reported by another player. 
*   If you create a full account, we will store your username and sign-in IDs, and track gameplay information across platforms. If you are a child user, we will also send your parent’s email to SuperAwesome, so your parent can set your permissions regarding personal information in the game.
*   To protect our child users, we use your date of birth, country, and IP address to verify whether you are a child or not. We do not store this.
*   If you are in a lobby when another player reports you, your username, IP address, and gameplay information may be stored for moderation purposes.
*   If you buy something in the game, we may receive additional personal information to fulfill those purchases.
*   If you reach out to us directly, we may use that information to help fix the problem you reported.
*   Please do not put private information in your username or chat. Someone may use or save it even if we do not.

**Website:**

*   If you buy something on our website, we will use your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, payment information, and purchase history to fulfill those orders.
*   If you sign up for our marketing newsletter, we will use the email address you provide.
*   If you reach out to us directly, we may use the information provided to help fix the problem you reported.

**Privacy Policy**

Effective Date: May 18, 2021

Innersloth LLC, a Washington limited liability company (“**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**,” and their derivatives) provides websites, including [www.innersloth.com](http://www.innersloth.com/) and its subdomains (collectively, the “**Websites**”), video games, including Among Us (collectively, the “**Games**” and each, the “**Game**”), and other online services (collectively, with the Websites and the Games, the “**Services**”).

**1.** **What does this Privacy Policy cover?** 

This Privacy Policy (this “**Policy**”) sets forth how we collect, use, protect, store, disclose, and otherwise process your Personal Information (defined below). Because we do not process any Personal Information for the Dig2China and Henry Stickmin Collection Games, those Games are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

This Policy also does NOT apply to information you provide to any third party or is collected by any third party (except as otherwise provided below).

By using our Services, you are confirming that you understand English well enough to understand this Policy. Should you have questions about this Policy, please contact us by emailing us at [privacy@innersloth.com](mailto:privacy@innersloth.com), so we can clarify and address your questions.

**2.** **How do we process Children’s Personal Information?** 

A “**Child**” is a person under the age of digital consent (i.e., 13 years old in the United Kingdom and United States and between 13 and 16 years old in the European Union). Please see below for a summary of our practices with respect to the collection of Personal Information from Children and the use and disclosure of such information.

Quick-Chat Mode

If a user of the Game self-identifies or is identified by us as being a Child, their gameplay experience will automatically be set to “Quick-Chat Mode,” unless the parent or legal guardian of the Child permits otherwise. Child users in Quick-Chat Mode (collectively, “**Child Users**” and each, a “**Child User**”) are restricted from communicating with or otherwise making their Personal Information publicly available to other users of the Game. Child Users will only be able to use a set of fixed phrases to communicate with other users in Quick-Chat Mode and will not have links to social media in the Game. Each of these features is designed to limit our access and the access of other users of the Game to the Personal Information of Child Users in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (“**COPPA**”).

Accounts

Child Users may register an account with us using a registration process similar to the one adults go through; however, in compliance with COPPA, Child Users will first be subject to a parental notice and consent process prior to activation of their account. To initiate the registration and consent process for a Child User, we collect a parent or legal guardian’s email address. We will automatically generate randomized usernames for registered Child Users, unless the parent or legal guardian grants the Child User permission to create a custom username.

Use and disclosure

The Personal Information we collect from or about Child Users is used to give them access to certain features of the Game and communicate with a parent or legal guardian about the Child User’s registration, including for the purpose of verifying their information in connection with the registration. We do not share or otherwise disclose Children’s Personal Information, except (1) as may be necessary to protect the safety of a Child, including by disclosing their Personal Information, where appropriate, to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety; (2) to enable us to take precautions against liability; (3) to protect the safety and security of the Game; or (4) where required to do so by law or legal process.

We and the third-party service providers listed below may collect or maintain Child Users’ Personal Information through the Game:

·         SuperAwesome Trading Limited

·         Unity Analytics

·         Zendesk

Please contact us with questions about our service providers’ privacy policies and our collection and use practices by emailing us at [privacy@innersloth.com](mailto:privacy@innersloth.com) with the subject line “Children” or mail your request to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073.

At any time, a parent or legal guardian may review their Child’s Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete such Personal Information, request that we delete their Child’s account, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using their Child’s Personal Information by contacting us using the email address provided above. To protect parents and legal guardians’ privacy and security and the privacy and security of Children, we may require a parent or legal guardian to take certain steps or provide additional information, which we will keep strictly confidential, to verify their identity before we provide any information about the Child or make any corrections.

SuperAwesome

Verifiable Consumer Requests under CCPA

To exercise your rights described above, please email us at [privacy@innersloth.com](mailto:privacy@innersloth.com) with the subject line “CCPA” or mail your request to Innersloth LLC, PO Box 2532, Redmond, WA 98073. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your Child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

*   Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.

*   Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

Response Timing and Format under CCPA

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request under CCPA within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
