Child users in Quick-Chat Mode (collectively, “<strong>Child Users</strong>” and each, a “<strong>Child User</strong>”) are restricted from communicating with or otherwise making their Personal Information publicly available to other users of the Game. Child Users will only be able to use a set of fixed phrases to communicate with other users in Quick-Chat Mode and will not have links to social media in the Game. Each of these features is designed to limit our access and the access of other users of the Game to the Personal Information of Child Users in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”).</p><p>Accounts</p><p>Child Users may register an account with us using a registration process similar to the one adults go through; however, in compliance with COPPA, Child Users will first be subject to a parental notice and consent process prior to activation of their account. To initiate the registration and consent process for a Child User, we collect a&nbsp;<a>parent or legal guardian’s&nbsp;</a>email address. We will automatically generate randomized usernames for registered Child Users, unless the parent or legal guardian grants the Child User permission to create a custom username.</p><p>Use and disclosure</p><p>The Personal Information we collect from or about Child Users is used to give them access to certain features of the Game and communicate with a parent or legal guardian about the Child User’s registration, including for the purpose of verifying their information in connection with the registration.
